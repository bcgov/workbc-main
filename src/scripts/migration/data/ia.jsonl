Her face heated as she realized she\u2019d spoken up in a room with well over a hundred people. She\u2019d been quietly listening to a panelist discussion at the Women in Trades Conference, but when someone asked about the success rate of the Industry Training Authority (ITA) <a href=\"http:\/\/youth.itabc.ca\/programs\/train\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Youth Train in Trades Program<\/a> (formerly ACE-IT), Cressen knew she had to speak up.<br\/><br\/>Cressen is incredibly passionate about the Youth Train in Trades program, as she describes the career she now enjoys because of it. She\u2019s proud to not only be working for the Surrey School District, but also for being recognized as the first female carpenter hired by them. Cressen found the program helped her discover her own path and, at the age of 22, she enjoys an established career.<br\/><br\/>Cressen credits a large part of her success to her teachers and would like to acknowledge all those who helped her along the journey of becoming the person she is today.<br\/><br\/>\u201cThe teachers are both passionate and compassionate about what they do. I honestly would not be here today without them! If you are struggling with a concept, they will take the time to help you figure it out before moving on to the next step.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Cressen doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to sharing tips about her success. She wants youth considering trades to know what it takes to succeed. She encourages young adults\u2014especially young women\u2014by letting them know they\u2019re capable of enjoying the type of success she\u2019s experienced, \u201cI\u2019ve walked onto a jobsite as the only female among 150 men. It\u2019s intimidating, but you have to have the confidence to say, \u2018I\u2019m good at what I do, and I wouldn\u2019t be here if I wasn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d She admits getting there takes time, and she knows she was fortunate enough to be in a related environment growing up. Her father, a gas fitter and a plumber, often brought her along on side jobs and gave her the opportunity to help. \u201cAlso, he didn\u2019t want to hire a babysitter,\u201d she adds with a laugh.<br\/><br\/>Cressen is clear proof that seizing unfamiliar opportunities can help aid both your career and personal development. In the process, the mentoring she received influenced her decision to volunteer with ITA, and now she\u2019s paying it forward with advice to others. Thank you, Cressen, for sharing your story!<\/p>","Page Blurb":"Learn how the ITA Youth Train in Trades Program helped Cressen become the first female carpenter with the Surrey School District."}

It may be eye fatigue caused by increased screen time. <br\/><br\/>Two years ago, COVID-19 changed our lives. Before we knew what was happening, many of us started working from home. Life quickly turned digital in other ways as school, work and social interactions \u2013 such as happy hour, games nights and family celebrations \u2013 started happening online. <br\/><br\/>It\u2019s no surprise to learn that TV viewing, internet usage, and video game participation also increased.

Try to complete this task at regular intervals throughout the day, if possible.<\/li><li><em>Take micro-breaks away from your computer screen. <\/em>Give your eyes a break and use the opportunity to get up and stretch.<\/li><li><em>Make your breaks tech free. <\/em>Eat your lunch at your kitchen table, not in front of your computer.<\/li><li><em>Alternate how you complete your work.<\/em> If possible, substitute digital with paper and pen. Using paper or a whiteboard can give your eyes a rest from the computer screen.<\/li><li><em>Get outdoors and exercise during the day, such as taking a walk at lunch. <\/em>Getting some fresh air, exercise and a change of scenery can provide positive physical and mental benefits, as well as give your afternoon the boost it may need. Also, try not to revert to another screen after work (i.e., television, personal computer or your phone). Get outdoors or participate in an activity that does not require being online.<\/li><\/ol><p><br\/>Screen time affects many aspects of our well-being, whether it be for work, school or leisure time. However, we can make changes to limit the amount of time in front of a screen. Take note of what your patterns are and the possible steps you can take to reduce your screen time.

However, when she entered high school, she wasn\u2019t sure how to put her goal into action. It was difficult for her to visualize how her secondary education could contribute to a fulfilling career after graduation. So she reached out to her teachers and her older sister for advice.<br\/><br\/>Kendra\u2019s teachers set her up with a three-week electrical co-op experience, to give her a chance to try the trade out and see if it was the right fit. It was this positive work experience that helped her confirm where she wanted to go.<br\/><br\/>When she returned to school, Kendra wanted to continue her career development. It was her sister\u2014a recent carpentry graduate\u2014who recommended she try the district trade program to gain valuable training in her field. Kendra found that the program allowed just the right balance of work and school to keep her focused. \u201cBeing able to get out into the workforce, then come back and learn in a classroom, really helped strengthen my experience,\u201d she says.<br\/><br\/>In hindsight, Kendra sees how her time in high school prepared her for success in the trades, noting \u201cEverything I did was oriented toward becoming an electrician.\u201d Kendra\u2019s required secondary coursework and the trades-related shop classes she had taken in high school all contributed to her promising career. She even viewed her math courses with new appreciation, recognizing how classroom knowledge linked directly to her work.<br\/><br\/>Kendra\u2019s career direction opened the door for her to take on different opportunities. Her participation in the Skills Canada Competition for Electrical Wiring helped her discover her competitive side. To prepare for the event, she built a 4\u2019 by 4\u2019 cubicle mini-construction zone to train with and give herself an edge\u2014helping her bring home a silver award!<br\/><br\/>Aside from her competitive success, Kendra had the chance to use her trade-based skills to give back to her community. She chose to volunteer for the St. Paul\u2019s Hospital Lights of Hope event, which raises money every year for the hospital and medical research. She worked on a team responsible for the hospital\u2019s light display\u2014the primary attraction of the fundraiser. The versality of Kendra\u2019s career allowed her to put her talent toward a worthwhile community initiative.<br\/><br\/>Kendra never imagined the opportunities that would come her way as a result of her trades training. She now has a new perspective on her education and is committed to ongoing learning. She suggests people should connect with mentors in different career fields to gain insight into potential job paths. \u201cIt\u2019s important having someone to connect to,\u201d Kendra says. \u201cI had my sister to guide me.\u201d Kendra\u2019s journey demonstrates how a little curiosity and encouragement can sometimes be the right combination for career success.<br\/><br\/>Find out more about becoming an electrician, by viewing the <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/12867138\" >WorkBC career profile and Career Trek video<\/a>.<\/p>","Page Blurb":"Discover how Kendra\u2019s motivation and connections with the right people led her to a prospective career."}
{"title":"Networking","id":13697504,"template":"Standard Page","Page title":"Networking","Page Description":"","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p>Statistics show that 80% of job vacancies are not advertised. In some regions, that percentage is higher. Networking is a vital way to identify work opportunities and connect with potential employers in the \u201chidden\u201d job market.<\/p><p>Your current social circle, both online and offline, is a good place to start to expand your network of acquaintances, but you\u2019ll find other excellent networking opportunities listed below. Whatever networking strategies you employ, expanding your network will expand your prospects.<\/p><h4>Networking for career development<\/h4><p><strong>Volunteer \u2014 <\/strong>This is a fine method for broadening your network and allowing prospective employers to discover your abilities. You can gain experience, make connections, demonstrate your skills and get noticed. Volunteering provides an opportunity for word to spread about your talents and availability. And sometimes paid employment grows directly out of volunteer activities.<\/p><p><strong>Join a job club \u2014 <\/strong>For those who are eligible, job clubs have many advantages: you quickly find out you are not alone, discover which job-search methods that are working for people, and gain a built-in network of people who know people. Someone in the job club may have a friend or relative looking for a landscaper, which may be your job target. You never know when an opportunity could present itself.<\/p><p><strong>Find groups in your area(s) of interest \u2014 <\/strong>Join a new group to build your network. If you like computers and are passionate about programming, find a programming user group. Such groups allow you to build lasting, mutually helpful professional relationships. As you become connected, you\u2019ll likely discover career opportunities.<\/p><p>If you don\u2019t know how to find a group, you can use a search engine like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meetup<\/a> to find groups in your field and community. For example, search \"Programming user group Penticton.\"<\/p><p><strong>Tell community groups you are a part of \u2014 <\/strong>Organizations you are already part of may have many members, some of whom already know you well. Talk to them about your career or job-search goals. If people don\u2019t know that you\u2019re looking for work, then they can\u2019t share any opportunities with you.<\/p><p><strong>Social media networking \u2014 <\/strong>These days, social media is an excellent method for connecting with employers and job opportunities. Find out more about using social media in your job search below.<\/p><p><strong>Attend job fairs \u2014 <\/strong>Job fairs are another great opportunity to connect with people: employers who are seeking workers, employment service providers and other job seekers. Even if a company isn\u2019t looking for someone with your background, they may know of someone else who is. They may be happy to pass on your resume or keep it for their own future needs. Be proactive and do some homework on the companies you plan to approach at the job fair (participating companies are usually listed in advance event notices). Your obvious interest and preparation will increase your chances of winning an interview.<\/p><p><\/p><p>When networking, always thank the people who have given you advice or contacts by emailing or mailing them a thank-you note. Networking is all about building relationships. Showing that you appreciate the time of a person who helps you is your investment in a relationship that may ultimately benefit both of you.<\/p>","Related topic URL":["https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14626355","https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14610785","https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14607029","https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/12593129","https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/12593231"],"Page Blurb":"<p>Good networking skills are key to making connections with potential employers.<\/p>"}

But when she first tried welding in shop class, she quickly discovered her new career path. \u201cI never thought welding would be something I like\u2014it was a big eye-opener,\u201d she explains.<br\/><br\/>She wants to show other girls that there are careers in what she likes to call the hands-on, \u201cmessy\u201d trades. Although she found welding difficult at first, she refused to give up and continued to expand her skills\u2014even venturing into the realm of metal art! Sarah excitedly describes a few of her creative projects, including various garden ornaments and even a copper corsage she crafted for her grad ceremony in 2019.<br\/><br\/>No longer a novice, she stresses the importance of patience and persistence. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to be the best on your first try. You have to ask for help, get pointers, try different things\u2014and take lots of notes,\u201d she laughs.<br\/><br\/>Yet, while Sarah was making major career decisions, she received some life-altering news. She describes the experience of being diagnosed with high-functioning autism while still in high school, and she admits she was initially worried it would impact her future. However, the additional support she received through her school helped her develop the confidence to tackle bigger projects head on. Sarah now views her diagnosis as an empowering moment in her life. \u201cA lot of people think that mental health is a setback, but I like to think of it as [just another] challenge that helps you grow.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Because she was able to gain credits toward her welding certificate while still a student, Sarah was able to start her career before graduating secondary school. She completed her Red Seal exam in early 2020 and is currently logging enough work hours to become an official Red Seal Welder\u2014which will allow her to work across Canada.

When she was in school, her teacher told her that the best welder he had ever met was a woman\u2014which encouraged her to keep going. Sarah hopes her story will one day provide similar inspiration to young apprentices.<br\/><br\/>When it comes to a career in the trades, Sarah leaves other young adults considering with one final piece of advice: \u201cJust jump in with both feet. Don\u2019t hesitate with the trades! I know it\u2019s nerve-wracking at first, but you\u2019ll fit in eventually as you get a feel for how the shop works.

Whether you use Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, it\u2019s important to spread the word that you\u2019re looking for work. <br\/><br\/>If you don\u2019t let anyone know that you\u2019re searching for jobs, then the potential to network and advertise your skills is wasted. The next time you\u2019re on your favourite social media site, make sure you let your friends and followers know that you\u2019re looking for a job. Your friends may not know of any immediate job openings, but if any come up, they\u2019ll definitely think of you if they know you\u2019re looking. <br\/><br\/>Social media is all about spreading the word, so be sure to spread your message as far as possible.<\/p><h4>Create a professional profile<\/h4><p>Many employers are now using social media to help screen potential hires, so if you applied for a job recently, there\u2019s a good chance that your profile has been looked at by someone in the company you applied to. <\/p><p>For this reason, it\u2019s very important that you tidy your online profiles by removing any questionable photos or messages before you start looking for work. It\u2019s also a good idea to replace your profile picture with one that shows your professionalism and good taste. <\/p><p><\/p><p>If you\u2019d prefer to keep your profile private, make sure that you update the privacy settings on any of the sites you use to ensure that only your friends can view your content.<\/p><h4>\u201cFollow\u201d or \u201clike\u201d career experts<\/h4><p>One of the great things about social media is how quickly you can access the latest job-search advice and trends. Sites like Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and LinkedIn are teeming with recruiters, bloggers, career counsellors and HR personnel who are eager to share their expertise with job seekers. <\/p><p>Whether it\u2019s an infographic, blog post, article or study, you\u2019ll find plenty of useful information and tips on social media that can help you land your dream job. The next time you go online, make sure you devote some time to follow the experts or companies in your field of interest.<\/p><h4>Make connections<\/h4><p>Due in part to the marketing potential of social media and its growing user base, many employers are now using social media as a way to spread company news, job postings, and promotions. <\/p><p>And because it\u2019s so fast and easy to spread the word through social media, many employers are now announcing job opportunities on their social media feeds long before they post them on job boards or newspapers.

He recalls, \u201cI thought it was just programming and coding, but it was completely different than I expected it to be.\u201d What started out as a desire to expand his computer-based skills, ultimately led him to pursue a dual degree in computer science and psychology\u2014which he is currently completing at Stanford University.<br\/><br\/>Support from his friends and family have helped Michael navigate his goals, along with one simple strategy: \u201cYou have to start small when working toward your goals.\u201d He explains that he wasn\u2019t always this motivated, and he had only begun making further education plans in his last few years of secondary school. He started to make small changes in Grade 10, spending more time studying and learning new ways to better apply his time. Looking back, he sees how far he has come and how those small decisions helped along the way.<br\/><br\/>He advises other young adults searching for purpose in their career or education journey, to pursue interests that hold personal meaning. He suggests, \u201cFocus on what you are passionate about. You have to look back and think about what makes you happy, and work on making time for that. For me, I\u2019m passionate about helping people and learning skills that will help me do that.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Inspiration comes from different sources, and Michael credits his Inuvialuit heritage for where he is today. However, his community has been significantly impacted by the high suicide rates among Inuit youth. Michael lost two friends to mental health struggles in 2019, and hence advocates for improving access to mental health care in communities like his. Michael sees his dual computer science and psychology degree as the first step toward contributing to future mental-wellness innovation.<br\/><br\/>Michael believes that talking about an issue is the first step toward making impactful change. He notes how a lot of people around him, including himself, have experienced depression\u2014which is why it\u2019s important to talk openly about mental health. Michael knows there is an opportunity to make a difference by letting others know they are not alone. As a student, Michael is determined to learn more about mental health\u2014with the hope of one day applying his knowledge to help people impacted by it.<br\/><br\/>Michael\u2019s story demonstrates how career goals can be influenced by many different factors, and sometimes it takes a little creativity to combine the topics close to heart and set yourself on the right career path.<br\/><br\/><em>Read the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14607011\" ><em>Skills for the Future Workforce<\/em><\/a><em> competency list to learn more about the skills employers are looking for.<\/em><br\/><br\/><em>The <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthlinkbc.ca\/mental-health-substance-use\/resources\/kuu-us-crisis-line\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>KUU-US Crisis Line<\/em><\/a><em> is a culturally-safe 24-hour resource for suicide prevention for Indigenous people in British Columbia.

In fact, just a few short weeks later, she found herself part of the team working on the development of various vaccines for COVID-19. <\/p><p>A big part of Lilin\u2019s job is to connect with partners that use the company\u2019s specially-designed delivery technology. The technology produced by Acuitas is an important part of the vaccine process that makes sure that the treatment gets into our cells. <br\/><br\/>In addition to her work supporting the business side of the company, Lilin helps to put initial legal agreements in place with new partners. She also takes charge of, and provides support for, projects in marketing, finance and human resources. She is always quick to jump in where needed and finds that she learns a great deal by doing this.<br\/><br\/>Lilin moved from China to Canada when she was six years old. Growing up in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside, she found that playing sports was a great way to make friends in the community. Lilin noticed the positive effect of sports on her physical and mental health, which inspired her dream of working in an area that had some connection to health care. In secondary school, she joined a business club, which opened the door to wanting to learn more about the corporate world. That\u2019s when she knew that she wanted to put her two interests together into a career. Lilin\u2019s dream to have a career that included both health and business shaped her decision to complete a Bachelor of Kinesiology and a Master of Management degree at the University of British Columbia.<br\/><br\/>Outside of school, Lilin took on a range of jobs and volunteer roles that would help her gain skills. \u201cI wanted to make sure that I had some experience in the two sectors in addition to my education so that when I graduated, I could find a job that would be both challenging and rewarding.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Lilin credits much of her career success to the big sacrifices her parents made for her. She says, \u201cMy parents gave up their deeply-rooted life in China to make our home in Canada, and they did so with very little resources. They wanted to give me the opportunity for a better life. I have seen them work hard their entire lives to be able to take care of our family. The drive for all of my efforts is to make them proud and to give back to them for everything they have done and continue to do for me. They are my inspiration.\u201d<br\/><br\/>While currently working from home because of the pandemic, Lilin says that she still gets to connect with her co-workers. They have biweekly check-in video calls with the entire team and access to an internal company communications channel where staff can chat and share photos, videos and news \u2014 similar to how it would be if they were all in the office in person. Lilin says that it has helped the team to stay in touch.<br\/><br\/>For those looking to jumpstart their career, Lilin\u2019s advice is to be open and flexible stating, \u201cIf you are prepared to take on different tasks that support the needs of your organization, you never know what might come from it. You could spark an interest in an area that you didn\u2019t know you had.\u201d She adds, \u201cBe open to opportunities that come your way and always put forth your best effort \u2014 you never know where that might take you!\u201d<br\/><br\/>Are you looking to build a career you can be passionate about?

She was looking for a steady job where she could continue to learn, grow and be challenged in a positive way. After some research into different careers, she decided nursing would be the best fit. <\/p><p>It wasn\u2019t an easy change to make. Lisa had to first upgrade a few high school courses and she continued to work to support herself while attending nursing school. As she looks back at her journey now, she realizes that she has achieved so much more than just a \u201csteady job.\u201d She has found a career where she makes a difference in peoples\u2019 lives. Despite the work being difficult some days, Lisa describes it as incredibly fulfilling. <br\/><br\/>As a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) at a hospital in the Fraser Valley, Lisa\u2019s role has her moving throughout the facility \u2014 from attending the Emergency Room to accompanying a patient being transferred by ambulance to a specialist appointment. <br\/><br\/>\u201cA typical day doesn\u2019t exist at my job,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI work shift work \u2014 usually 12 hours. When I walk through the door, I have to be ready for anything \u2014 and I am.\u201d Lisa adds that the variety is the best part, \u201cOne of the things I love about my job is that each day is so different.\u201d<br\/><br\/>As for working during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lisa explains that while much has changed \u2014 especially for health care workers directly treating COVID-19 patients \u2014 in other ways, some things have stayed the same. For hospital workers, regular handwashing, wearing masks, using hand sanitizers and deep cleaning high-traffic areas happens every day. They are aware of how infectious diseases can spread and they do everything they can to minimize that risk. <br\/><br\/>She points out it\u2019s hard for patients in the hospital who can\u2019t have family members, stating, \u201cThat might be one of the more difficult things It is heartbreaking to see people who are sick and unable to find comfort in a hug from a family member.\u201d <br\/><br\/>As a nurse, Lisa is often with people, patients and families on some of the most difficult days of their lives. \u201cThere are multiple layers to the work that I do. What some people don\u2019t realize is that there is also an emotional piece to my job. I treat people who are in pain and who may be really scared. It is important that as a nurse, no matter what I am feeling, they see me as calm and capable and that they feel confident that I am there to help them. That is a big part of the work that I do,\u201d she says.<br\/><br\/>Lisa is committed to reaching out to help new nurses. She remembers the people who went out of their way for her and how much that support meant. She explains, \u201cI am grateful for the people who took the time for me. My goal is to do the same for others. In fact, I see it as my responsibility. One small act of kindness, support or show of compassion can make a huge difference in someone\u2019s life. That\u2019s important to remember.\u201d <br\/><br\/>In her spare time, Lisa has found great ways to relax and re-energize. Lisa, her partner and their rescue dog regularly hike, camp and spend time in nature. The physical demands of the hike let her burn off some of the stress from work. She also kayaks, runs and loves to cook. Lisa believes that it\u2019s important to enjoy life outside of work stating, \u201cIt helps to keep you balanced in all aspects of your life.\u201d <br\/><br\/>Are you interested in pursuing a career in healthcare?

Marilou explains that while her job requires a great deal of skill, knowledge, patience and know-how, she is often reminded why she continues to work \u2014 at an age when others might consider winding down their career or even looking at retirement. For Marilou, the decision is quite simple: \u201cI love helping people find the right house or apartment\u2026 at whatever stage of life they are in. There is such magic in helping someone find a place to call home. There is nothing like it.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Marilou \u2014 who now works in partnership with her son and his husband \u2014 still gets a thrill when her phone rings with a new client or when someone puts in an offer on one of her listings. She is confident that her wealth of experience still offers a great deal to her clients stating, \u201cWe are seeing more and more people working later in life \u2014 and I know for me, I choose to put a spotlight on the length of my experience. It is an asset. I think those of us who are a bit older have a great deal to contribute. We need to be confident about our age \u2014 not shy away from it.\u201d<br\/><br\/>On any given day, Marilou is on the go. She explains, \u201cOur days are busy! We might be handing over keys to a young couple who are expecting. Then it\u2019s off to a showing across town. Then it\u2019s back to another neighbourhood to pick up keys that will be handed over to a different excited buyer later that day. There are always texts, calls and emails that need a quick response. Nothing stands still in real estate.\u201d And that means neither does Marilou. <br\/><br\/>That said, working during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how Marilou and her team do their jobs. For instance, instead of regular open houses, there are now online virtual showings. She also says that for in-person showings \u2014 which now only happen with people who are very serious about buying the property \u2014 masks are a must, and there is a great deal of cleaning that goes on between appointments. Likewise, weekly in-person company meetings have become Zoom video calls, which Marilou confesses she prefers because they are more efficient. <br\/><br\/>It\u2019s not just work that is busy. Marilou has an active social life and loves to spend time with friends and family. She participates in The Ride to Conquer Cancer and has found a love for cycling. In addition, Marilou takes her rescue dog on walks and hikes \u2014 giving them both fresh air and exercise. \u201cI find that the more I stay active, the more energy I have,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when I find something that works, I stick with it!\u201d<br\/><br\/>Making a difference in peoples\u2019 lives is what drives Marilou. She says, \u201cIf you want to be in this business, do it because you genuinely want to help people. For me, there is nothing more rewarding.\u201d Along with her job, Marilou finds purpose as a volunteer facilitator with a mental health program through Vancouver Family Connections, a local non-profit. She also believes that it\u2019s important to balance out all of the activity by slowing down a bit and sitting back to enjoy life. Marilou reveals her secret formula to a happy life, \u201cFor goodness sake, don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone \u2014 especially on social media! You see people on there who seem to have perfect lives, but that\u2019s all an illusion. Be who you truly are and don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone.
