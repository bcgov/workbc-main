Government has annually increased funding for health services and facilities, which will contribute to the increase in new job openings for nurses.<\/p><p>The current demand for nurses in all regions and settings in the province is strong. However, the current supply of nurses and new graduates is in short supply, particularly in northern and rural regions. To address this situation, the B.C. provincial government has created additional training spaces in public post-secondary institutions, and has offered loan forgiveness to nursing graduates who commit to work in under-served regions of the province.<\/p><p>The demand for nurses in specialty areas, such as operating rooms, emergency rooms and critical care is also strong, with many openings in the Mainland\/Southwest region. In addition, experienced registered nurses and specialty nurses are also needed to teach students and train new graduates. The demand for nurse educators is increasing as many current nursing educators are nearing retirement. Other areas, such as medical-surgical units are also having a hard time recruiting and retaining registered nurses.<\/p><p>The role of nurses is expanding as governments consider ways to control increasing health-care costs. One approach is offering basic care through a mixed team that consists of doctors and other health professionals. Nurses would work alongside doctors and provide patient care in situations where a doctor's skills are not required. These workers are called nurse practitioners, which is a new, self-directed role for nurses.<\/p><p>The number of registered nurses working in residential\/complex care is expected to decrease due to cost pressures and the current shortage of registered nurses. There is also a trend towards providing assisted living rather than intermediate care facilities. This will further reduce the employment opportunities for registered nurses in complex care. As a result, several health-care authorities are now introducing LPNs into home care nursing.<\/p>","Resources":[{"Resource Title":"B.C.

For some consumers, this means a preference for healthy, high-end products and specialty baked goods, such as gluten free, dairy free or high protein items. <br\/><br\/>There are now many bakeries that offer organic products to meet specialty demands. Some larger companies, such as supermarket chains and hotels, have responded to these demands by opting for on-site bakeries. These trends have created a demand for skilled bakers, particularly those with trade certification.<br\/><br\/>Working for a small bakery may provide more opportunity to be creative and hands-on in providing ideas for what products might be baked and sold. The job of baker at a larger business, such as a restaurant, hotel or wholesale bakery, may be more task-related because the baking is done in huge commercial-size batches, which means that precise measurement, timing and more operational aspects are the focus. <br\/><br\/>Supply chain issues can make it challenging for a baker to get the ingredients or supplies needed to fulfil the production schedule. Smaller bakeries, cafes and restaurants may need their bakers to replace ingredients or to think of a different product to bake using the ingredients available. <br\/><br\/>Social media has created opportunity for people with baking skills to show off their abilities. Some bakers have created small home-based businesses by taking orders via social media platforms or by creating sponsored content that is paid for by the companies that manufacture baking ingredients and tools.

Labour market conditions for the industry are expected to recoup lost ground in the coming years as the economic recovery strengthens and U.S. home construction increases.<\/p><p>As well, some jobs will be created in response to the need to harvest pine beetle damaged wood, but many openings will arise from retirements or from those who leave the industry to pursue other careers.<\/p><p>There is currently a shortage of fallers in B.C. Factors including an aging workforce, increased harvesting due to the pine beetle problem in the interior, as well as an exodus of many current fallers are contributing to the shortage. Recruitment is difficult due to the part year and hazardous nature of the work, as well as negative public perceptions of the Forestry and Logging industry.<\/p><p>Advances in technology will also likely negatively impact this group since these advances allow more work to be completed with fewer workers. Industry sources report that logging operations on the B.C. coast will use more mechanized skidding and harvesting equipment due to an increase in selective logging operations as more second growth timer is harvested. This will result in an increase in demand for skidder operators, while also gradually decreasing the demand for fallers and chainsaw operators in that region.<\/p>","Resources":[{"Resource Title":"B.C.

A cook is someone who can put together a meal by following a recipe, whereas a chef uses their formal training to create original dishes. A chef understands flavours and textures and how they go together. They are skilled in complex cooking techniques and can create recipes from scratch using fresh ingredients. A chef is more likely to have a high level of responsibility in the kitchen, which may include deciding what is on the menu. <br\/><br\/>Chefs need to stay up to date on new culinary trends and have an idea of what customers are looking for. They need to plan menus months in advance and have a good idea of what will be popular and available. They must understand the cost of specialty items and stay within their budget. They may also need to come up with ideas if a key ingredient becomes unavailable. Since restaurant guests are concerned about how their food is grown or raised, chefs must also stay informed. <br\/><br\/>Negotiation and people skills are important tools for a chef. Building relationships with suppliers is also an asset. Getting specialty ingredients at a reasonable price or having the first pick of popular items is key in this competitive industry.<br\/><br\/>Maintaining a solid network with other chefs, cooks and kitchen workers is an important part of building a strong career. It creates a collaborative industry where culinary professionals support each other, something industry sources say is critical for the success of the chef and the restaurant. <br\/><br\/>Some chefs raise their profile and personal brand through social media, such as Instagram. They create a fan base by showcasing new dishes, specialties and other unique talents.<\/p>","Resources":[{"Resource Title":"British Columbia Chefs' Association","Resource Link":"www.bcchefs.com"},{"Resource Title":"British Columbia Restaurant and Foodservices Association (BCRFA)","Resource Link":"www.bcrfa.com"},{"Resource Title":"Canadian Culinary Federation","Resource Link":"www.culinaryfederation.ca\/en"},{"Resource Title":"Canadian Culinary Institute","Resource Link":"www.ccicc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Canadian Personal Chef Alliance","Resource Link":"www.cpcalliance.com"},{"Resource Title":"Go2HR Job Board","Resource Link":"www.go2hr.ca\/jobs"},{"Resource Title":"Red Seal Program","Resource Link":"www.red-seal.ca\/eng\/w.2lc.4m.2.shtml"},{"Resource Title":"Restaurants Canada","Resource Link":"www.restaurantscanada.org"},{"Resource Title":"SkilledTradesBC","Resource Link":"www.itabc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"WorkBC Trades Training","Resource Link":"www.workbc.ca\/trades"}]}

However, to be eligible for certification, individuals should have completed either a three-year apprenticeship program through the Industry Training Authority or have a combination of work experience in the trade and some college or industry courses.<\/p><p>Assessment is conducted by an independent third party. Level 1 certification allows trainees to work directly under the supervision of a qualified operator.

Under the regulation, existing operators are allowed to continue operating.

Electricians usually work indoors, often on a construction site or in a home.<br\/><br\/>People with this job may need to work from heights or in small spaces. Heavy lifting may be needed, and the work can be physically demanding. Safety is a priority and precautions are followed to reduce the risks of injury from accidental electric shocks and falls from heights.<br\/><br\/>Depending on the project, some electricians work with other trades on construction\/development sites. Others, especially those working on smaller residential projects or repairs, may deal directly with customers.<\/p>","Career Pathways Content":"<p>As with many trades, apprentices are chosen from existing employees, such as construction labourers. Experienced electricians can move up to supervisory positions as foreperson, superintendent, estimator or electrical inspector. Some experienced electricians may choose to start their own businesses.<br\/><br\/>Electricians may also decide to work as industrial electricians.

This includes Vancouver Island, the Lower Mainland, the Okanagan, Kamloops, Prince George and the Kootenays. In some regions of British Columbia, volunteer firefighters provide fire and rescue services. Working with a volunteer fire department is a good way to gain experience and professional connections for those who want paid employment.<br\/><br\/>There tends to be a steady supply of qualified candidates looking for work. Currently, there is a great deal of competition for available openings. However, ongoing retirements and competition from other industries for workers may limit the future supply of qualified firefighter candidates. Also, most fire departments are trying to increase the diversity of the force to better represent the communities they serve.<br\/><br\/>While it is a very rewarding job, the role of a firefighter can be physically, mentally and emotionally challenging. The role requires dedication and often personal sacrifice because of the work schedule. At times, the firefighter must stay overnight at the firehall, rather than at home. Firefighters work holidays, evenings and weekends. They can also be called in at a moment\u2019s notice to work in different areas or countries in response to large-scale disasters.<\/p>","Resources":[{"Resource Title":"British Columbia Professional Fire Fighters Association","Resource Link":"www.bcpffa.org"},{"Resource Title":"Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs","Resource Link":"cafc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Emergency Management BC","Resource Link":"www2.gov.bc.ca\/gov\/content\/safety\/emergency-management"},{"Resource Title":"Fire Chiefs' Association of British Columbia","Resource Link":"www.fcabc.bc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Fire Recruitment Canada","Resource Link":"firerecruitment.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Office of the Fire Commissioner","Resource Link":"www2.gov.bc.ca\/gov\/content\/safety\/emergency-management\/fire-safety"},{"Resource Title":"Search and Rescue Safety Society of British Columbia","Resource Link":"www.sarbc.org"},{"Resource Title":"Vancouver Fire Rescue Services","Resource Link":"vancouver.ca\/your-government\/vancouver-fire-and-rescue-services.aspx"},{"Resource Title":"Volunteer Firefighters' Association of British Columbia","Resource Link":"www.firebc.org"}]}

They must be careful while examining patients, which means using safety equipment and clothing and making sure that these are removed or properly cleaned when they are done using them.<\/p><p>General practitioners must be ready to deal with patients who may be upset and worried about their health.

Field work locations also vary depending on the specialization of the work and the location of the work site. As an example, geologists or geomorphologists may frequently travel to remote field sites by helicopter or other means and cover large areas on foot, whereas geological and geophysical oceanographers often collect data while at sea. Exploration geologists and geophysicists often are required to relocate, as their work requires them to live in different communities adjacent to work sites, in remote areas of B.C., other parts of Canada or overseas.<\/p><p>Geoscientists usually work regular hours; however, they may be required to work longer hours when required due to seasonal site access limitations, remote location or data gathering equipment requirements.

Geoscientists may experience exposure to extreme weather conditions, insects, wildlife and other outdoor hazards while working in the field. Field work such as gathering samples may require geoscientists to hammer, dig, use tools, and come in contact with water, snow and ice. Physical stamina is important for doing field work, since this requires carrying rock samples and heavy equipment.<\/p><p>Industry sources also report that the globalization of mineral exploration has resulted in many B.C.-based geoscientists working on projects in other countries and climates around the world, often in developing countries in remote rural settings. As such, the risk of infections, diseases and simple injury (because of the distance from modern medical care facilities) is now greater.

B.C. is expected to experience difficulty filling skilled labour positions in the coming years, which will likely impact demand for workers as businesses, both public and private, will increasingly need personnel and recruitment officers to assist in recruiting and retaining skilled labour.<\/p><p>Many human resource professionals work for specialized consulting and recruitment firms that provide services to smaller clients unable to hire full-time workers. It is also becoming increasingly common for companies to hire consultants to do specialized work, rather than hiring a full-time human resources employee, so there may potentially be increased opportunities in private sector firms.<\/p><p>The demand for intermediate and senior personnel and recruitment officers will be greatest in larger urban areas or with larger employers in more remote locations, while rural areas are expected to have greater difficulty in obtaining skilled workers.<\/p><p>Applicants who have experience, as well as the ability to process and interpret data, prepare and deliver presentations and have a broad understanding of human resources trends will be most in demand by employers.

For both careers, this could mean a concentration on residential (homes), commercial (hotels, restaurants, retail stores), corporate (offices and businesses) and healthcare (hospitals, clinics and health\/wellness spaces). Some may specialize further. For example, an interior designer might focus on kitchens or bathrooms and an interior decorator might only work on small condos, single family homes or corporate offices.<br\/><br\/>A growing area of focus is sustainable interior design, which tries to minimize the environmental impact of the materials used in the building while still providing an attractive, comfortable space with good flow. This could include using bamboo flooring instead of hardwood or adding a rooftop garden. It could also include ensuring that air quality in the home is clean and promotes a healthy living environment.<br\/><br\/>Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is the leading organization for interior design certifications that offers the designation as a sustainable designer.<br\/><br\/>For interior decorators, this may include using recycled and fair-trade items to furnish and accessorize the home. It may also include ensuring that paints, wall coverings and other elements do not contribute to poor air quality.<br\/><br\/>Interior decorators may decide to open their own firm when first starting their career. Interior designers are more likely to work with established interior design firms or other related companies as they build their experience and credentials.

It reached record lows in 2008 and 2009, with work in the sector nearly 8,000 jobs less than in the previous five years. Labour market conditions for the industry are expected to recoup lost ground in the coming years as the economic recovery strengthens and U.S. home construction increases.<\/p><p>In the short term, new jobs will be created in B.C. in response to the need to harvest pine beetle damaged wood. There may continue to be activity in B.C.'s interior after the pine beetle problem has been taken care of. Other species of timber that are ready to be harvested have been left untouched since most resources have gone towards solving the pine beetle problem.<\/p><p>Also, as the economy recovers, good opportunities for job seekers will continue due to the limited number of experienced workers available to fill openings that arise from job growth and retirements.<\/p><p>Across B.C. high retirement rates and the inability of most firms to recruit and retain young workers to replace retirees are contributing to a labour shortage in this occupation. Many experienced machine operators have left the forest sector to seek work in the Mining and Oil and Gas industries, which previously offered more consistent work and similar pay. In addition, most new, young workers interested in machine operation also looked for work in the Mining, and Oil and Gas industries for similar reasons.<\/p><p>Negative public perceptions of the forest sector and the unwillingness of many young people to live outside of urban centers is also making it difficult for logging companies to find new workers.

Typically, people with this job support miners who are more specialized. They may work as a part of a team or on their own. They may be supervised or take direction from the more specialized miners or other senior workers on the job site. <br\/><br\/>Mine labourers need to be flexible and adapt to different ways of doing things. They must also be able to work under pressure while understanding and following safety regulations. <br\/><br\/>People in this job need mechanical skills. They must also be able to read and write, communicate with co-workers, have basic analytical skills as well as follow instructions.<\/p>","Duties Content":"<p><strong>Mine labourers:<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>Assist other mine workers to maintain and construct underground installations<\/li><li>Clean underground rooms, roadways, working areas and mining equipment<\/li><li>Transport and organize materials\/supplies<\/li><li>Clear away spills of ore or coal<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p>","Work Environment Content":"<p>Mine labourers typically work for mining companies. This job is physically and mentally demanding since those working at surface operations are exposed to all weather conditions and those working underground experience a dark and damp setting.<br\/><br\/>Mine labourers may be exposed to potential hazards, including chemicals and loud noises. They may also work near large, moving machinery. High-level safety standards ensure that work sites follow strict safety regulations. This includes wearing eye, ear and respiratory protection, protective clothing with reflectors, gloves, hard hats and steel-toed boots.<br\/><br\/>Since mines are often located in remote areas, underground production and development miners may be required to travel and live at the mining camp for weeks or months at a time. However, many B.C. mines are located near communities, and workers who live nearby can return home after their shift. In some cases, the cost of living can be lower in these remote communities.<br\/><br\/>Most mine labourers work full-time and very few work part-time or are self-employed. They often work more than 40 hours per week, but many do not work year-round. Shifts usually last eight to 12 hours a day and rotating shift work is common because mines operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This means they may work unusual hours. Shift length can vary depending on the location and urgency of the project.<\/p>","Career Pathways Content":"<p>The mine labourer role is an entry level position into the mining industry.

Also, mine labourers may also be required to move from mine to mine, depending on the project needs and the length of their contract. <br\/><br\/>Mine labourers often spend a great deal of time outdoors in extreme weather conditions (hot in summer and cold in winter). More people are worried about climate change and how natural resources are being extracted and used. Some people think that mining does damage to the environment. This means that mine labourers and other mine workers may have to face community members and advocates who oppose mining by protesting at the site. At times, it can be challenging to access the work site due to active protests.

As the population grows, people are choosing to live in the suburbs and commute to their jobs. This means more vehicles on the road which results in more accidents and a greater demand for auto body repair work. However, new technology in vehicles, such as anti-lock brakes and dent-resistant body panels, helps reduce the number of accidents and repairs needed. Newer vehicles involved in accidents are less likely to be repaired due to the high cost of fixing and replacing complex body parts and electronic components.<br\/><br\/>The electric vehicle (EV) market is growing as people choose to drive environmentally friendly vehicles. This may have impacts on this career since EVs require fewer repairs. These factors may limit opportunities for motor vehicle body repairers.<br\/><br\/>Some workers with this career may work on a flat rate which means that they will be paid for the work done as outlined in the rates, rather than by the hour. For those who can work quickly and do a good job, they may be able to earn more this way than by being paid hourly.<br\/><br\/>There is higher demand for workers who continue their training, learn new technology and know how to work with new materials, systems, tools and techniques.<\/p>","Resources":[{"Resource Title":"Automotive Industries Association (AIA) of Canada","Resource Link":"www.aiacanada.com"},{"Resource Title":"Automotive Retailers Association (ARA)","Resource Link":"www.ara.bc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Canadian Collision Industry Forum (CCIF)","Resource Link":"www.ccif.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Red Seal Program","Resource Link":"www.red-seal.ca\/eng\/w.2lc.4m.2.shtml"},{"Resource Title":"Skilled Trades Employment Program (STEP)","Resource Link":"www.stepbc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"SkilledTradesBC","Resource Link":"www.itabc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Trades Training BC","Resource Link":"www.tradestrainingbc.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Unifor","Resource Link":"www.unifor.org"}]}

Increased international competition, a high Canadian dollar, increasing energy prices, the inability of growers to obtain outside investment, and the wide availability of greenhouse grown vegetables have lead to decreased profit margins for growers. These trends will continue to have a negative effect on work opportunities for greenhouse workers in the province<\/p><p>In addition, improvements in greenhouse and nursery technology have led to increased automation\/mechanization. Fewer unskilled workers are now needed for manual labour tasks, but more skilled workers are needed to operate equipment.<\/p><p>In recent years, increasing housing and commercial construction in B.C. had a positive effect on the nursery and greenhouse sector, thereby providing new work opportunities. A high level of construction activity fuelled growth in the landscaping industry, which led to increased demand for nursery and greenhouse grown plants. This trend had a positive effect on work in retail and wholesale nurseries and in greenhouses.<\/p><p>Many greenhouse and nursery workers left the occupation to work in other industries which offer year round employment. This was a major contributing factor to the shortage of these workers during peak seasons, particularly in rural regions. As a result, many employers hired foreign workers who came to Canada through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program, which was put in place to help with shortages of unskilled labour during harvesting seasons. As a result, foreign workers accounted for a large share of nursery and greenhouse workers in B.C.<\/p><p>Work demand will continue to be highest in the Fraser Valley in particular, where most greenhouse and nursery operations in the province are located.<\/p><p>Job opportunities will be highest for experienced workers and for those who have completed horticulture related courses and training programs. Increased use of Integrated Pest Management practices will raise the demand for workers with Pest Applicator Certification.<\/p><p>Employment opportunities are abundant in harvesting seasons, however, full-time work throughout the year is difficult to secure without further education or extensive experience.<\/p>","Resources":[{"Resource Title":"B.C.

Over the last decade years, Canada's aging population has led to a rapidly increasing number of prescriptions being filled by pharmacists. The largest increase in pharmacy activity has taken place in community pharmacies that are located in food and general merchandise stores. Many jobs will be created in retail pharmacies as more supermarkets and general merchandisers open pharmacies in their stores.<\/p><p>The aging population is putting increased pressure on hospital pharmacies. According to the Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists, an increasing number of hospitals, especially in small centres, have reported long-term vacancies for pharmacists. Many pharmacists are leaving hospitals to work in community pharmacies. One reason for this may be that hospital pharmacists generally earn a lower wage than community pharmacists, despite working under more stressful conditions. Temporary vacancies that result from maternity leaves are also difficult to fill.<\/p><p>Industry reports a current shortage of pharmacists in B.C. In particular, rural communities are short of both community and hospital pharmacists. As such, demand for pharmacists in these smaller communities is high.<\/p><p>As employers in under-served regions tend to experience difficulties in hiring these professionals when vacancies occur, the B.C. provincial government has offered loan forgiveness to physiotherapist graduates who commit to work in these regions. For more details on the loan-forgiveness program, please view the StudentAid BC website at <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaidbc.ca\/repay\/repayment-help\/bc-loan-forgiveness-program\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/studentaidbc.ca\/repay\/repayment-help\/bc-loan-forgiveness-program<\/a>.<\/p><p>Graduates of clinical and non-clinical hospital pharmacy programs, and pharmacists with previous experience working in hospitals, are also in demand in the province.

Some jobs, especially in rural regions and in-home care, may require travel.<\/p><p>Recently, there have been large increases in home care, both publicly and privately funded. This is due to the increase in releasing acute patients from hospitals. There has also been an increase in the number of private physiotherapy practices over the past 10 years.<\/p><p>People in this job may use electrophysical agents such as ultrasound, laser and electrical stimulation devices. Possible health risks that come from the use of these devices (for both patient and operator) can be managed by using the devices properly and following the right process in treatment.<\/p><p>In most work settings, a physiotherapist will lift, bend and walk often.

Some work for businesses, governments, social welfare agencies or private research firms. Others work in institutions, including clinics, prisons, hospitals, courts, mental health facilities, schools and universities. Many psychologists work in a combination of settings.

They also often work in teams with other health-care professionals.<br\/><br\/>Psychologists deal with complex and stressful situations.

They are bound by a strict code of ethics and they must keep information confidential while making judgment calls on potential risks to their clients or others. Psychologists may also face the pressure of research and publication deadlines.<br\/><br\/>Psychologists working in private practice usually work in offices. They may meet with clients outside of regular office hours. Many enjoy the flexibility of being able to set their own hours. Psychologists who work in institutions \u2013 like hospitals \u2013 keep regular daytime hours, but may also work some evenings and weekends. Psychologists in colleges and universities also tend to work regular hours, dividing their time between teaching, research and administrative tasks.

Others choose to transfer their skills and knowledge to other careers in health care.<br\/><br\/>Workers with a bachelor's degree can assist psychologists and other mental health professionals in clinical settings or in data collection and analysis.

Currently, there appear to be more individuals looking for employment in the lower mainland than there are jobs available.<\/p><p>As Manufacturing industries employ a significant number of purchasing agents and officers, changes in these industries have a considerable impact on employment. In particular, manufacturing activity has experienced a regional shift in the past 20 years. Much of the physical plant operational capacity is now performed offshore, while the design, marketing and distribution facilities remain in the Lower Mainland region. Despite this shift in the Manufacturing industry, resource processing is still dominant in B.C., especially in northern B.C., where the province's pulp and paper mills, mineral processing plants, and petroleum and coal production plants are located.<\/p><p>Changes in the public sector have an effect on employment of purchasing agent. Industry sources report that fewer purchasing agents are needed in the public sector due to the declining importance of goods-acquisition. There is, however, an increasing need for service procurement specialists who work on much higher volumes of services procurement, which are often more complex acquisitions. These acquisitions require greater responsibility, independent decision-making and a wider range of skills.<\/p><p>Industry sources also report that the number of workers employed in supply chain management in the service sector in B.C. is growing, and has become larger than in other provinces. Technological changes have led purchasing agents and officers into more strategic supply management as they spend less time processing manual purchasing requests or doing more routine work of keeping record of past bids and offers and tracking supplier performance. Instead, these workers are able to spend more time consulting with product development teams. Employers will look for purchasing agents and officers with well developed strategic business planning skills and knowledge of office and supply management software.<\/p>","Resources":[{"Resource Title":"Canadian Supply Chain Management Association","Resource Link":"www.scmanational.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Purchasing Management Association of Canada (PMAC)","Resource Link":"www.pmac.ca"},{"Resource Title":"Supply Chain Management Association of B.C.","Resource Link":"www.scmabc.ca"}]}

However, due to the small size of this occupational group, the number of openings will be somewhat limited.<\/p><p>In recent years, a number of factors, such as environmental concerns, land use legislation, the rising Canadian dollar, a declining U.S. housing market, trade disputes and mill closures, have reduced the demand for logging activity in B.C.. As a result, the need for reforestation and enhanced silviculture activity (such as pruning, spacing and thinning young trees) has declined. This has reduced the need for silviculture and forestry workers.<\/p><p>On the other hand, other factors may have a somewhat positive impact on this occupational group. For example, a provincial government plan to shift from old-growth to second-growth harvesting in coastal forests involves cultivating faster-growing trees, increased fertilization and a shorter growth-to-harvest cycle. This activity, as well as a planned increase in the planting and harvesting of deciduous hardwoods, would increase opportunities for silviculture workers if put into place.<\/p><p>In addition, climate change is contributing to significant changes in provincial forests. In recent years, the mountain pine beetle and forest fires have destroyed millions of hectares of woodland. The silviculture industry is likely to play a role in the restoration of these areas.<\/p><p>Silviculture and forestry workers are now required to capture more information about a broader array of resources, including fish, wildlife, soils, and cultural and heritage features. There has also been a gradual increase in the amount of technology and mechanization used in these jobs. As a result of these developments, more in-depth training of these workers is required. Industry sources also predict more opportunities for workers highly skilled in prescribed burn and fuel management for ecosystem restoration.<\/p><p>Demand for forest firefighters varies, but is generally steady during long, dry summers. However, the majority of firefighters hired by the British Columbia Forest Service are workers with previous experience who are recalled to work rather than new hires.

Welders do not need trade certification to work as a welder in B.C. However, there are three levels of welder certification available in B.C.: levels C, B and A. Level C certification is a prerequisite for level B certification, which is a prerequisite for level A certification.<\/p><p>Each certification level may be completed in a modular format or through a formal apprenticeship. The modular format requires more in-school training than the apprenticeship format for all levels of certification. Each level takes one year to complete and requires a mix of documented training and work experience.<\/p><p>Apprenticeships can be started in secondary school, through entry-level training at colleges and technical institutes, or by direct entry, where workers find a sponsor employer who is willing to participate in the program. For more information, see the Industry Training Authority website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itabc.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.itabc.ca.<\/a><\/p><p>Interprovincial Red Seal Certification is available for welder levels B and A. Those who complete level C will receive an Industry Training Authority Certificate of Qualification.<\/p><p>Levels C, B and A may be challenged with 2,700, 5,400 and 7,020 hours, respectively, of documented directly related work experience. Level C certification is required before challenging level B certification. Applicants for challenge tests must pass both a written and practical examination.<br\/><br\/>Welders who are certified for that occupation by a regulator elsewhere in Canada can apply for the same certification from the regulator in B.C. Under the terms of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfta-alec.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)<\/a>, most applicants who are transferring their credentials from elsewhere in Canada will not be required to complete additional training or testing. However, the B.C. regulator may ask applicants to provide further information such as a letter of good standing, references, or criminal record check.<br\/><br\/>For those who trained outside of Canada and never received certification from any Canadian jurisdiction, a full assessment is likely needed.
