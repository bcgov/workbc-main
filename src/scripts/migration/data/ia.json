    "Page Content": "<p>Marilou Appleby is a bundle of positive energy. \u201cSometimes, I am amazed that I have been in this career since 1986,\u201d says the REALTOR\u00ae. Marilou explains that while her job requires a great deal of skill, knowledge, patience and know-how, she is often reminded why she continues to work \u2014 at an age when others might consider winding down their career or even looking at retirement. For Marilou, the decision is quite simple: \u201cI love helping people find the right house or apartment\u2026 at whatever stage of life they are in. There is such magic in helping someone find a place to call home. There is nothing like it.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Marilou \u2014 who now works in partnership with her son and his husband \u2014 still gets a thrill when her phone rings with a new client or when someone puts in an offer on one of her listings. She is confident that her wealth of experience still offers a great deal to her clients stating, \u201cWe are seeing more and more people working later in life \u2014 and I know for me, I choose to put a spotlight on the length of my experience. It is an asset. I think those of us who are a bit older have a great deal to contribute. We need to be confident about our age \u2014 not shy away from it.\u201d<br\/><br\/>On any given day, Marilou is on the go. She explains, \u201cOur days are busy! We might be handing over keys to a young couple who are expecting. Then it\u2019s off to a showing across town. Then it\u2019s back to another neighbourhood to pick up keys that will be handed over to a different excited buyer later that day. There are always texts, calls and emails that need a quick response. Nothing stands still in real estate.\u201d And that means neither does Marilou. <br\/><br\/>That said, working during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how Marilou and her team do their jobs. For instance, instead of regular open houses, there are now online virtual showings. She also says that for in-person showings \u2014 which now only happen with people who are very serious about buying the property \u2014 masks are a must, and there is a great deal of cleaning that goes on between appointments. Likewise, weekly in-person company meetings have become Zoom video calls, which Marilou confesses she prefers because they are more efficient. <br\/><br\/>It\u2019s not just work that is busy. Marilou has an active social life and loves to spend time with friends and family. She participates in The Ride to Conquer Cancer and has found a love for cycling. In addition, Marilou takes her rescue dog on walks and hikes \u2014 giving them both fresh air and exercise. \u201cI find that the more I stay active, the more energy I have,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when I find something that works, I stick with it!\u201d<br\/><br\/>Making a difference in peoples\u2019 lives is what drives Marilou. She says, \u201cIf you want to be in this business, do it because you genuinely want to help people. For me, there is nothing more rewarding.\u201d Along with her job, Marilou finds purpose as a volunteer facilitator with a mental health program through Vancouver Family Connections, a local non-profit. She also believes that it\u2019s important to balance out all of the activity by slowing down a bit and sitting back to enjoy life. Marilou reveals her secret formula to a happy life, \u201cFor goodness sake, don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone \u2014 especially on social media! You see people on there who seem to have perfect lives, but that\u2019s all an illusion. Be who you truly are and don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone. This is where happiness resides.\u201d <br\/><br\/>Are you interested in pursuing a career in real estate?

    "Page Content": "<p>Struggling with eye strain, blurred vision or headaches? It may be eye fatigue caused by increased screen time. <br\/><br\/>Two years ago, COVID-19 changed our lives. Before we knew what was happening, many of us started working from home. Life quickly turned digital in other ways as school, work and social interactions \u2013 such as happy hour, games nights and family celebrations \u2013 started happening online. <br\/><br\/>It\u2019s no surprise to learn that TV viewing, internet usage, and video game participation also increased. According to Stats Canada, <a href=\"https:\/\/www150.statcan.gc.ca\/n1\/pub\/82-003-x\/2020006\/article\/00001-eng.htm\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">internet traffic grew by 40 to 60 per cent<\/a> during the spring 2020 global lockdown period. Streaming services also saw an increase in new registrations. The result \u2013 a large increase in screen time and a higher chance of having eye issues. <br\/><br\/><strong>What can you do? <\/strong><br\/><br\/>Here are five tips to help reduce eye strain due to increased screen time:<\/p><ol><li><em>Give your eyes a rest.<\/em> Follow the 20-20-20 rule: take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and look at something 20 feet away. Try to complete this task at regular intervals throughout the day, if possible.<\/li><li><em>Take micro-breaks away from your computer screen. <\/em>Give your eyes a break and use the opportunity to get up and stretch.<\/li><li><em>Make your breaks tech free. <\/em>Eat your lunch at your kitchen table, not in front of your computer.<\/li><li><em>Alternate how you complete your work.<\/em> If possible, substitute digital with paper and pen. Using paper or a whiteboard can give your eyes a rest from the computer screen.<\/li><li><em>Get outdoors and exercise during the day, such as taking a walk at lunch. <\/em>Getting some fresh air, exercise and a change of scenery can provide positive physical and mental benefits, as well as give your afternoon the boost it may need. Also, try not to revert to another screen after work (i.e., television, personal computer or your phone). Get outdoors or participate in an activity that does not require being online.<\/li><\/ol><p><br\/>Screen time affects many aspects of our well-being, whether it be for work, school or leisure time. However, we can make changes to limit the amount of time in front of a screen. Take note of what your patterns are and the possible steps you can take to reduce your screen time. You will feel the benefits.<br\/><br\/>What will you try?<\/p>",

The global economy, evolving technology and company workforce restructuring are shifting work opportunities in some sectors from full-time to part-time and\/or to contingent staffing (outsourcing).<br\/><br\/>Due to these forces, many of today's workers don't work for organizations on a permanent basis. They may be independent contractors, contract company workers, on-call workers, temporary workers who are hired directly or through an agency, \"solopreneurs\" and others.
