Early Learning Framework to guide their work. They must keep up the standards set out in B.C.\u2019s Child Care Licensing Regulation.<\/p>",
    "Work Environment Content": "<p>Most early childhood educators (ECEs) and assistants (ECEAs) work in licensed settings such as child-care centres, StrongStart BC centres, before- and after-school programs or preschool programs. These can be located in schools, community centres or workplaces that offer child care to their employees. The work is varied, depending on the setting.<\/p><p>ECEs and ECEAs may work full time or part time, and hours can vary. Preschool and school-based programs usually run during the school year. Most child-care centres are open all year. They may have longer hours or use staggered shifts to fit the needs of working parents. There is a growing demand, for example, for late-night child care by parents who work shifts.<\/p><p>Working with young children and families can be very rewarding. It can also be physically and emotionally demanding. Workers may suffer back strain or other discomfort from time spent standing, walking, sitting on the floor, bending and lifting. They can be exposed to illness by sick children, as well as to challenging issues in the classroom.<\/p>",
    "Career Pathways Content": "<p>Career paths<\/p><p>Recent graduates often find jobs in child-care centres, preschools, community centres or parks and recreation departments.

Some operate private child-care facilities. Those with more education may become infant development consultants, supported child development co-ordinators, child-care directors, administrators for early childhood education centres, or ECE instructors in colleges or universities. Some may choose to train to work as educational assistants with school-aged children.<\/p><p><\/p>",

However, the B.C. regulator may ask applicants to provide further information such as a letter of good standing, references, or criminal record check.<\/p><p>For those who trained outside of Canada and never received certification from any Canadian jurisdiction, a full assessment is likely needed.

If the person has the education needed, they can apply for entry into the CPA PEP which is offered directly through the CPA. The CPA PEP is made up of six accounting subject areas and can be completed in 24 months of part-time study. Once the CPA PEP is completed, the next step is to take the nationally administered Common Final Examination (CFE).<\/p><p>To earn the CPA designation while working on completing the academic requirements, the person will also have to do a minimum of 30 months of relevant practical experience.<\/p><p>CPA is the designation created in 2013 for professional accountants across Canada.

    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>Technology has changed the accounting profession. As more accounting functions become automated, auditors and accountants can spend more time understanding financial information and creating management strategies. In addition, things like blockchain, cryptocurrency and other changing areas of focus require people in this career to continue to learn both through formal training and by keeping up to date through media, lectures and industry conferences.<\/p><p>The role of an accountant is expanding and as a result, people in this profession are taking on new responsibilities, such as:<\/p><ul><li>Financial strategy development<\/li><li>Financing leadership and support<\/li><li>Creating financial systems to support the strategic direction of an organization<\/li><li>Financial information analysis<\/li><li>Environmental safety assessments<\/li><li>Computer system audits<\/li><li>Corporate restructuring<\/li><\/ul><p>Many of the higher-level roles are better suited to Chartered Professional Accountants rather than undesignated accountants. More and more, financial auditors work with systems, rather than the data itself, to make sure that the systems work and that the data is kept confidential. In the past, this role was limited to financial auditing, but in today\u2019s world, their duties are growing, and financial auditors are being asked to create company-wide financial plans.<\/p><p>Accountants may be asked to give their opinions on the security of the company\u2019s financial information, its financial health or how well its systems work. In addition, they may be asked to review and show any potential risks to the company\u2019s financial health.<\/p><p>Some employers may want to hire financial auditors or accountants that have skills that are not specific to financial work. This could include being able to work in diverse groups and to present ideas to others. A person in this role might also need to have public speaking or leadership skills. They should also be able to actively listen to co-workers and clients, and to connect with clients and to help build professional relationships.<\/p><p>In many cases, professional accountants in Canada follow international standards of practice. With the increase in trade between Canada and other countries, new opportunities are coming up for accountants and financial auditors who speak more than one language. More employers want accountants and auditors with international experience and knowledge, including how to handle foreign exchange management and sales tax issues.<\/p>",

    "Work Environment Content": "<p>Firefighters work for municipal, provincial and federal governments, as well as for large industrial organizations with internal firefighting services. People in this career spend a lot of their time in fire halls or training facilities preparing to handle a variety of emergency situations. <br\/><br\/>In large urban centres, firefighters typically work shifts with rotating days off.

This type of help is usually readily available for firefighters who request it.<br\/><br\/>The work environment is often dangerous and can include extreme temperatures (both high and low), smoke as well as other airborne chemicals\/irritants. Firefighters are often needed at the centre of large-scale natural and other disasters. They also may be required to get into small or tight spaces or do their work at extreme heights.<br\/><br\/>Firefighters follow strict safety procedures to maintain their own health\/safety as well as the health\/ safety of others.<\/p>",

    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>Career positions for firefighters are usually more available in cities or more largely populated areas. This includes Vancouver Island, the Lower Mainland, the Okanagan, Kamloops, Prince George and the Kootenays. In some regions of British Columbia, volunteer firefighters provide fire and rescue services. Working with a volunteer fire department is a good way to gain experience and professional connections for those who want paid employment.<br\/><br\/>There tends to be a steady supply of qualified candidates looking for work. Currently, there is a great deal of competition for available openings. However, ongoing retirements and competition from other industries for workers may limit the future supply of qualified firefighter candidates. Also, most fire departments are trying to increase the diversity of the force to better represent the communities they serve.<br\/><br\/>While it is a very rewarding job, the role of a firefighter can be physically, mentally and emotionally challenging. The role requires dedication and often personal sacrifice because of the work schedule. At times, the firefighter must stay overnight at the firehall, rather than at home. Firefighters work holidays, evenings and weekends. They can also be called in at a moment\u2019s notice to work in different areas or countries in response to large-scale disasters.<\/p>",

Once enrolled as a TFT, individuals are required to complete 24 months of acceptable work experience and must write part A and part B of the Registered Forest Technologist (RFT) exam. On passing, they can then become an official RFT.<\/p><p>For more information, see the ABCFP website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.abcfp.ca\/\" >www.abcfp.ca<\/a>.<\/p><p>The Applied Science Technologists and Technicians of British Columbia (ASTTBC) organization certifies the occupation of forest engineering technologists. An individual who has completed a college program in forest technology can register with the ASTTBC as a graduate technologist or technician. After completing a minimum of two years of work experience, individuals can then apply to become a certified member. Certification under ASTTBC is transferable among provinces.<\/p><p>For more information, see the ASTTBC website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.asttbc.org\/\" >www.asttbc.org<\/a>.<\/p><p>Those who are certified for an occupation by a regulator elsewhere in Canada can apply for the same certification from the regulator in B.C. Under the terms of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfta-alec.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)<\/a>, most applicants who are transferring their credentials from elsewhere in Canada will not be required to complete additional training or testing. However, the B.C. regulator may ask applicants to provide further information such as a letter of good standing, references, or criminal record check.<br\/><br\/>For those who trained outside of Canada and never received certification from any Canadian jurisdiction, a full assessment is likely needed. Most occupational regulators have a process for assessment and recognize internationally trained applicants.<br\/><br\/>For details on how to apply for certification in B.C., contact the <a href=\"https:\/\/asttbc.org\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Applied Science Technologists and Technicians of BC<\/a> and\/or the <a href=\"https:\/\/portal.nrs.gov.bc.ca\/web\/client\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development: Forest Policy and Indigenous Relations Division, Timber Pricing Branch<\/a>. <br\/><br\/>For information about labour mobility in Canada, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.workersmobility.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.workersmobility.ca<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>View a list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Jobs-Careers\/Explore-Careers\/B-C-Occupational-Regulators.aspx\" >B.C. occupational regulators<\/a>.<\/p>",

    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>There will be a significant number of job openings as a result of both new job creation and the need to replace experienced workers who retire.<\/p><p>Employers have found it difficult to attract young skilled people to the Forestry and Logging industry and retain them. This problem may become worse as older workers retire. In recent years, the number of graduates in this field has also been decreasing.<\/p><p>Demand for forestry-related employment services are expected to be constrained by the limited growth in related activity in government agencies and forestry companies. As well, there has been increased consolidation of companies and greater use of technology to remain globally competitive, which will continue to limit job creation. These trends are expected to result in limited employment growth for forestry technologist and technicians.<\/p>",

    "Work Environment Content": "<p>Family physicians mostly work in community-based, independent medical offices and can set their own hours and workload. Some may have to work nights and weekends, and may also be on call 24 hours a day when they need to respond to emergencies. Most family physicians work long hours, which could be from 60-100 hours per week.<\/p><p>Family physicians often work in teams and with other health care providers, such as pharmacists, nurses and nurse practitioners. In the coming years, physicians in primary and community care settings will be expected to work more in teams which include nurses and health care workers with a range of skills.<\/p><p>Better technology has led to changes in the way that care is provided. General practitioners often use resources such as video, telephone and email communication to support patients, including electronic medical records, prescriptions and results. They are also using computer-based education and information resources more regularly.<\/p><p>In this career, family physicians see patients who need different types of help, support or treatment each day. Due to this kind of work, they are exposed to illnesses. They must be careful while examining patients, which means using safety equipment and clothing and making sure that these are removed or properly cleaned when they are done using them.<\/p><p>General practitioners must be ready to deal with patients who may be upset and worried about their health. This, along with working long hours, treating a large number of patients, and strict safety precautions, means that this can be a difficult job.<\/p><p>Practice management and clinical training programs, combined with targeted incentives, have greatly improved professional satisfaction. In addition, physicians are often driven by the need to help others.<\/p>",
    "Career Pathways Content": "<p>It is common for new family physicians to begin their careers by taking over for doctors who are on leave or on vacation. By doing this, they build experience and get a chance to try out different settings.<\/p><p>Currently, many family physicians choose to join an existing medical office when they graduate. Some continue through their career of providing primary care to patients, and many add a special interest area to their practice, such as hospitalist, palliative care, or occupational medicine. Many new graduates also add skills at the end of their training and work in areas such as emergency or maternity.<\/p><p>Family physicians may also work as hospital administrators, they may teach and\/or conduct research at educational institutions, or work for government, health authorities and other health-related organizations.<\/p>",

    "Education, Training and Skills Content": "<p>A Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) is required. Those who want to become a doctor usually complete four years of undergraduate training before taking four years of medical school. Medical schools have high academic admission requirements. University medical programs interview those who apply to make sure that along with good academic records, they also have the needed social skills and attitude to work as a physician.<\/p><p>Graduates of medical programs go through two years of formal residency training. The residency program is competitive, and graduates may need to travel to other provinces to do this. To become a fully licensed physician in B.C., graduates must pass two licensing exams given by the Medical Council of Canada, a national exam provided by the College of Family Physicians of Canada, and become licensed through the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. Doctors must maintain professional insurance.<\/p><p>The University of British Columbia (UBC) offers B.C.\u2019s only medical program, which is delivered throughout the province in partnership with other post-secondary institutions, health authorities and community physician practices. There are four regionally distinct sites:<\/p><ul><li>Island Medical Program (IMP) at the University of Victoria<\/li><li>Northern Medical Program (NMP) in Prince George at the University of Northern British Columbia<\/li><li>Southern Medical Program (SMP) in Kelowna at UBC Okanagan<\/li><li>Vancouver Fraser Medical Program<\/li><\/ul><p>Ongoing medical education and professional development are required throughout their careers to make sure that physicians keep up with changes and improvements in their field, and to ensure that they provide patients with modern treatments and up-to-date advice. All family physicians must complete at least 50 hours per year of continuing professional education throughout their career.<br\/><br\/>General practitioners and family physicians who are certified for that occupation by a regulator elsewhere in Canada can apply for the same certification from the regulator in B.C. Under the terms of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfta-alec.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)<\/a>, most applicants who are transferring their credentials from elsewhere in Canada will not be required to complete additional training or testing. However, the B.C. regulator may ask applicants to provide further information such as a letter of good standing, references, or criminal record check.<br\/><br\/>For those who trained outside of Canada and never received certification from any Canadian jurisdiction, a full assessment is likely needed. Most occupational regulators have a process for assessment and recognize internationally trained applicants.<br\/><br\/>Contact the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpsbc.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C.<\/a> for details on how to apply for certification in B.C.<br\/><br\/>For information about labour mobility in Canada, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.workersmobility.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.workersmobility.ca<\/a>.<br\/><br\/>View a list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Jobs-Careers\/Explore-Careers\/B-C-Occupational-Regulators.aspx\" >B.C. occupational regulators<\/a>.<\/p>",

    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>A growing and aging population will require more health services. This means that there will be more job openings for family physicians who want to run a family practice anywhere in B.C.<\/p><p>Overall, in the last few years, there has been an increase in the number of doctors treating patients. Still, in parts of the province, it is hard for some patients to find a family physician. Industry sources report that there is, and will continue to be, a strong demand for general practitioners throughout B.C., especially in northern and rural communities.<\/p><p>Physicians may receive incentives, such as signing bonuses, fee-for-service, flat-rate premiums or travel subsidies, if they move to certain rural communities to practise.<\/p><p>Even though opportunities for medical education in B.C. have gone up, there are still not enough graduates to meet the needs of our aging population. As a result, B.C. has filled gaps by recruiting physicians from other parts of Canada and around the world.<\/p>",

    "Work Environment Content": "<p>Geoscientists spend time both in an office and outdoors conducting field work. Field work locations also vary depending on the specialization of the work and the location of the work site. As an example, geologists or geomorphologists may frequently travel to remote field sites by helicopter or other means and cover large areas on foot, whereas geological and geophysical oceanographers often collect data while at sea. Exploration geologists and geophysicists often are required to relocate, as their work requires them to live in different communities adjacent to work sites, in remote areas of B.C., other parts of Canada or overseas.<\/p><p>Geoscientists usually work regular hours; however, they may be required to work longer hours when required due to seasonal site access limitations, remote location or data gathering equipment requirements. Those working in corporate, consulting or research positions may experience stress when facing deadlines to submit proposals, research grant applications and technical reports.<\/p><p>Field work in locations, such as mines, drill sites or rugged terrain, may expose individuals to safety hazards, which can be minimized with safety precautions. Geoscientists may experience exposure to extreme weather conditions, insects, wildlife and other outdoor hazards while working in the field. Field work such as gathering samples may require geoscientists to hammer, dig, use tools, and come in contact with water, snow and ice. Physical stamina is important for doing field work, since this requires carrying rock samples and heavy equipment.<\/p><p>Industry sources also report that the globalization of mineral exploration has resulted in many B.C.-based geoscientists working on projects in other countries and climates around the world, often in developing countries in remote rural settings. As such, the risk of infections, diseases and simple injury (because of the distance from modern medical care facilities) is now greater. However, this is a controllable risk if it is well managed.<\/p><p>Some geochemists may be exposed to health or safety hazards when handling certain chemicals; however, there is little risk if proper procedures are followed.<\/p>",
    "Career Pathways Content": "<p>New graduates may work as a geoscientist in training (G.I.T.) in order to obtain work experience necessary to become professionally designated.

    "Industry Highlights Content": "",
    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>New job openings will result from both the creation of new jobs and retirement.<\/p><p>There will be good opportunities for job seekers due to the relatively limited number of experienced workers available to fill job openings. Industry sources report that due to low levels of career recruitment and retention in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s, there are an insufficient number of highly qualified geoscientists available to replace experienced geoscientists who retire. Much of this gap is expected to be filled by immigration.<\/p><p>Industry sources also report that more geoscientists are expected to be based in the Lower Mainland, and less in other areas of B.C. Improved travel and instant communications make it easier for geoscientists to reside centrally and work remotely. There will be more opportunities for workers who have their Geoscientist In Training (G.I.T.) or Professional Geoscientist (P.Geo) designation.<\/p><p>New jobs in this occupational group will likely come from oil, gas and mining exploration activities in the province, or from activities in other part of the world being undertaken by companies based in B.C. Prices of oil, gas and certain metals and minerals have soared in recent years due to increased world demand, which will generate some new job opportunities. In particular, industry sources report that demand for workers in the minerals sector is currently strong, and there is an insufficient supply of new graduates to fill job vacancies.<\/p><p>Industry sources also reports that opportunities will also likely become available in the environmental geosciences sector. This sector employs the second highest number of geoscientists and is currently experiencing a significant shortage of qualified graduates.<\/p><p>Many of the growth opportunities for geologist, geochemist and geophysicist specialties are also expected to come from growth in business services that provide geological services, either internationally or to local companies involved in international exploration.<\/p><p>Industry sources report that there is expected to be a greater demand of geoscientists for land use planning, risk assessment and water resources management, and less demand of geoscientists for surveying and mapping. Sources also suggest that there is currently greater demand of geoscientists to work on independent power projects in B.C.<\/p><p>In addition, new graduates will be needed in field-oriented jobs, as older workers may have moved to senior positions or no longer wish to work in the occupation.<\/p><p>Industry sources also report that the globalization of mineral exploration has resulted in many B.C.-based geoscientists working on projects in other countries and climates around the world, often in developing countries in remote rural settings. As such, the risk of infections, diseases and simple injury (because of the distance from modern medical care facilities) is now greater.

Cost management measures include reduced hospital stays, increased outpatient services, and prevention and wellness programs.<\/p><p>Advances in medical technologies, treatments and procedures mean that these workers must stay on top of new innovations to be effective in their jobs.<\/p><p>Industry sources report that there is currently a significant shortage of respiratory therapists, particularly in larger hospitals, and that the current supply of graduates cannot fill the vacancies. To meet their staffing needs, B.C. employers continue to look for respiratory therapists from other provinces and internationally.<\/p><p>The current supply of clinical perfusion graduates is also insufficient due to a lack of a clinical perfusionist programs in western Canada.

Since the nature of the work is project-based and seasonal, working hours may be irregular and workers may experience gaps in work throughout the year.<\/p><p>Roofing work takes place almost entirely outdoors. As a result, roofers and shinglers are often required to work in rain, snow, summer heat and other weather conditions, sometimes with little or no protection. Roofers must be able to work at heights and must have the strength to carry heavy bundles or sheets of roofing material. The use of safety harnesses and lines helps to reduce the hazard of falling from heights.<\/p>",

    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>Security guards are needed to guard construction sites from theft and vandalism. As well, they are needed to protect most commercial and some residential buildings once construction is completed. Since many new graduates quickly move to higher paying jobs outside of the industry, there is currently a shortage of workers in B.C.<\/p><p>There will be growing demand for people with advanced security solutions training and threat\/risk assessment skills. Those with previous experience working as security guards, in law enforcement or in the military will have a greater chance of finding work.<\/p><p>Most work opportunities will continue to be in urban centres such as the Lower Mainland and Southern Vancouver Island regions where there are more facilities that require monitoring. There may be higher growth in any port area due to the Transport Canada changes to the Marine Security Act and enforcement.<\/p><p>Increasingly, security professionals are using computers and technological devices in their daily work, so workers must be comfortable using this equipment.. As the use of closed circuit television cameras increases, those who can use monitoring equipment and software will have more job opportunities. However, increased use of closed circuit television monitoring may reduce the number of patrolling security guards needed.<\/p>",

Outdoor work includes installing siding, roofing and gutters in all kinds of weather. <br\/><br\/>Sheet metal workers who do installation work have to bend, lift, stand, climb and squat, sometimes in small spaces or in uncomfortable positions. Often, people in this job lift heavy materials and equipment. Workers often use ladders and scaffolding and must be comfortable working from heights. <br\/><br\/>Sheet metal workers are trained to follow safety regulations and wear safety equipment to prevent injuries such as cuts from metal and burns from soldering and welding.<br\/><br\/>Parts of the job have been computerized and this technology has reduced the physical demands for workers. There is a growing need for sheet metal workers to have a good understanding of technology and computer skills since more companies have CNC (computer numerical control) cutting machines.<\/p>",

For more information please see the BC Forest Safety Council website at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bcforestsafe.org.\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.bcforestsafe.org.<\/a><\/p><p>The BC Safe Silviculture Project, a partnership between the BC Forest Safety Council and the Western Silvicultural Contractors' Association, has identified six silviculture functions that require training leading to competency certification. These include resource road driving, ATV operation, power saw operation, prescribed burning, wildfire fighting and silviculture supervision.

    "Industry Highlights Content": "<p>Learn about the opportunities in B.C.'s major industries, including employment trends, earning potential, locations of work and more.<\/p>",
    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>Employment opportunities are expected to arise from both new job creation and the need to replace experienced workers who retire. However, due to the small size of this occupational group, the number of openings will be somewhat limited.<\/p><p>In recent years, a number of factors, such as environmental concerns, land use legislation, the rising Canadian dollar, a declining U.S. housing market, trade disputes and mill closures, have reduced the demand for logging activity in B.C.. As a result, the need for reforestation and enhanced silviculture activity (such as pruning, spacing and thinning young trees) has declined. This has reduced the need for silviculture and forestry workers.<\/p><p>On the other hand, other factors may have a somewhat positive impact on this occupational group. For example, a provincial government plan to shift from old-growth to second-growth harvesting in coastal forests involves cultivating faster-growing trees, increased fertilization and a shorter growth-to-harvest cycle. This activity, as well as a planned increase in the planting and harvesting of deciduous hardwoods, would increase opportunities for silviculture workers if put into place.<\/p><p>In addition, climate change is contributing to significant changes in provincial forests. In recent years, the mountain pine beetle and forest fires have destroyed millions of hectares of woodland. The silviculture industry is likely to play a role in the restoration of these areas.<\/p><p>Silviculture and forestry workers are now required to capture more information about a broader array of resources, including fish, wildlife, soils, and cultural and heritage features. There has also been a gradual increase in the amount of technology and mechanization used in these jobs. As a result of these developments, more in-depth training of these workers is required. Industry sources also predict more opportunities for workers highly skilled in prescribed burn and fuel management for ecosystem restoration.<\/p><p>Demand for forest firefighters varies, but is generally steady during long, dry summers. However, the majority of firefighters hired by the British Columbia Forest Service are workers with previous experience who are recalled to work rather than new hires.
