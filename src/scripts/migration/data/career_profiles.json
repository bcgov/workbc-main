    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>Job opportunities are expected to come from retirements and new job creation.<\/p><p>The growing demand for health-care services will increase work opportunities for these workers. In particular, hospitals and related health-care facilities are expected to experience growth that will result in new jobs.<\/p><p>An older population will see an increase in respiratory ailments and cardiopulmonary diseases, such as pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and heart disease, thereby increasing the need for health-care workers in this group. Advances in treatment for heart attacks, accidents and premature babies will also continue to increase demand for workers in these occupations.<\/p><p>Growth in the Health Care and Social Assistance industry will be somewhat offset by efforts to better run the medical system so costs do not get out of control. Cost management measures include reduced hospital stays, increased outpatient services, and prevention and wellness programs.<\/p><p>Advances in medical technologies, treatments and procedures mean that these workers must stay on top of new innovations to be effective in their jobs.<\/p><p>Industry sources report that there is currently a significant shortage of respiratory therapists, particularly in larger hospitals, and that the current supply of graduates cannot fill the vacancies. To meet their staffing needs, B.C. employers continue to look for respiratory therapists from other provinces and internationally.<\/p><p>The current supply of clinical perfusion graduates is also insufficient due to a lack of a clinical perfusionist programs in western Canada. A new perfusionist program is now available at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.<\/p>",

    "Insights from Industry Content": "<p>Security guards are needed to guard construction sites from theft and vandalism. As well, they are needed to protect most commercial and some residential buildings once construction is completed. Since many new graduates quickly move to higher paying jobs outside of the industry, there is currently a shortage of workers in B.C.<\/p><p>There will be growing demand for people with advanced security solutions training and threat\/risk assessment skills. Those with previous experience working as security guards, in law enforcement or in the military will have a greater chance of finding work.<\/p><p>Most work opportunities will continue to be in urban centres such as the Lower Mainland and Southern Vancouver Island regions where there are more facilities that require monitoring. There may be higher growth in any port area due to the Transport Canada changes to the Marine Security Act and enforcement.<\/p><p>Increasingly, security professionals are using computers and technological devices in their daily work, so workers must be comfortable using this equipment.. As the use of closed circuit television cameras increases, those who can use monitoring equipment and software will have more job opportunities. However, increased use of closed circuit television monitoring may reduce the number of patrolling security guards needed.<\/p>",
