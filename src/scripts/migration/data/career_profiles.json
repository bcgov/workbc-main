As demand for editors is expected to be average, future jobs for new graduates will be limited due to tough competition from more experienced editors.<\/p><p>Many editors work in the traditional areas of newspaper and printed publications, which have seen little expansion. Advances in technology have affected this field of work, and the internet is having a noticeable impact on traditional media. As a result, editors need to be fluent in both traditional and new media in order to perform effectively. As well, there will be greater opportunities for editors with specialized training (e.g., legal editing, editing of technology websites, editing jobs requiring medical or science background).<\/p><p>In recent years, the Canadian book industry has experienced economic challenges. As a result, many book editors have turned to freelance or contract-based work as opposed to full-time employment at one firm.<\/p><p>Education and certification will likely become more important, and applicants looking for work in book editing will benefit from taking a university publishing program or earning a Master's degree in publishing. Membership in the Editors' Association of Canada will likely become more important to employers in the coming years.<\/p>",
