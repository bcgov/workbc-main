Not all resumes need to be in chronological order, so a strength-based resume may do a better job of highlighting your important skills.<\/p><p><strong>Awards and achievements<\/strong> \u2014 work-related, academic and community awards.<\/p><p>Include those relevant to the job you\u2019re seeking.<\/p><p><strong>Memberships<\/strong> \u2014 professional, business-related, school or community groups.<\/p><p>This is a great way to show a potential employer that you are an involved member of your community\u2014which shows that you will make an engaging co-worker and contribute to a positive work culture.

Here are a few tips and tricks to help you get started.<\/p><p><strong>Address your letter to the hiring manager or program leader<\/strong><\/p><p>Instead of just saying, \u201cTo whom it may concern,\u201d look at the job posting or the company\u2019s website to find the hiring manager\u2019s name to include in your letter.<\/p><p><strong>Use an outline<\/strong><\/p><p>Treat your cover letter like a short essay.

{"title":"More About SLMP Program Priorities","id":14626362,"template":"Standard Page","folder":"Who Should Apply","status":"Content Revisions","Page Title":"More About SLMP Program Priorities","Page Description":"","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p>The Sector Labour Market Partnerships (SLMP) program has identified the following known workforce issues:<\/p><ul><li>Recruitment and retention of youth (aged 15 to 29)<\/li><li>Diversity and inclusion in the workplace<\/li><li>New employment structures such as short term contracts and the \u2018gig\u2019 economy<\/li><li>The impacts of technology and automation in the workplace<\/li><\/ul><h3>Recruitment and Retention of Youth (aged 15-29)<\/h3><p>The B.C. population is aging. As a result, there is growing competition between employers to labour market hire entrants with job ready skills. To attract and retain young workers, employers need to align with youth\u2019s values, and support their professional development and career advancement. <br\/><br\/>The majority of young workers change employers within five years; those who stay longer are generally satisfied with the variety of work experiences, sense of purpose, professional development opportunities and the efficient utilization of their skills. Competitive wages are important to young workers, but wages are not be their only concern.<br\/><br\/>Some youth face disproportionately high barriers to employment; Indigenous youth, new immigrants, young people living in poverty, those who identify as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Employment-Services\/Community-and-Employer-Partnerships.aspx\" >LGBTTIQQ2S+<\/a>, young people with disabilities, racialized youth, and youth in rural\/remote communities.<br\/><br\/>Organizations should implement workforce strategies to reduce the barriers affecting these groups; those that do so will be in a better position to overcome the pressures of a shrinking workforce.<\/p><h3>Diversity and inclusion in the workplace<\/h3><p>Attracting and retaining underrepresented workers is one potential strategy for addressing labour and skill shortages. Evidence suggests increasing diversity and inclusion improves a company\u2019s financial performance and innovation as well. Some populations that are seeking equity in the workforce are:<\/p><ul><li>New Canadians (Immigrants with Citizenship)<\/li><li>Indigenous Peoples<\/li><li>People with Disabilities<\/li><\/ul><p>Improving workforce diversity requires a concerted effort to understand the barriers to entry and advancement, and an acknowledgement that better outcomes require organizational change, and a commitment to see these changes through.<br\/>Some human resource strategies that demonstrate success in improve diversity and inclusion include:<\/p><ul><li>enabling leaders to demonstrate inclusive behaviours;<\/li><li>creating a sense among employees that they can be their authentic selves;<\/li><li>providing sponsorship and mentorship opportunities; and<\/li><li>identifying clear career paths.<\/li><\/ul><p>Behaviours that create advantage for some and disadvantage for others need to be identified and addressed at a broad and systemic organizational level.<br\/> <\/p><h3>New Employment Structures and the \"Gig\" Economy<\/h3><p>Flexible employment contracts or the \u201cgig economy\u201d tend to categorize workers as independent contractors rather than employees. In Canada, there has been a move away from permanent full-time employment to part-time; the number of part-time jobs increased from 15% to 22% between 1976 and 2016 with a decline in full-time jobs from 85% to 78%.<br\/><br\/>Contract-based employment may be attractive to workers who value flexibility; however, there is a balance between increasing flexibility and the erosion of labour protections. Some skilled workers may have difficulty navigating the gig market which increases the risk that employers will not find qualified workers through this model. While contracting may allow employers to rapidly acquire the skilled workers they need, but presents a risk to corporate knowledge and intellectual property.<br\/><br\/>Employers should understand when it is appropriate to use contract-based employment, how these models can advance or hinder their long-term objectives, and what potential risks and issues may be introduced to their business models.<br\/> <\/p><h3>Technology and Automation in the Workplace<\/h3><p>Adopting technology is a form of innovation. Technological innovation is providing important economic opportunities. The digitization of work is enabling job seekers to enter new labour markets that were previously inaccessible.<br\/><br\/>However, technological innovations are also disrupting social and economic institutions that have been developed to support workers\u2019 rights. Online work erodes workers\u2019 rights, and the increasing automation of many job functions will have a mixed impact on occupations, industries, and the ability of the labour force to adjust to the future of work. <br\/><br\/>Automation is likely to affect the majority of workers in some way within the next 5-10 years. A 2017 report suggests that 50% of positions in the retail trade sector are vulnerable to automation.<br\/>Sectors that understand why, when, and how to utilize automation are better positioned to adapt their workforce accordingly, including retraining employees to focus on activities not easily automated.<br\/> <br\/>The Sector Labour Market Partnerships program funding is not limited to those issues listed above. If you are interested in learning more about how the Sector Labour Market Partnership program can help your sector, see our <u>Program Guidelines<\/u>, and contact us at: <a href=\"mailto:LabourMarketPartnerships@gov.bc.ca\" ><u>LabourMarketPartnerships@gov.bc.ca<\/u><\/a>.<\/p>","Card":[{"Card Type":[],"Title":"","Body":"","Image":[],"Link Text":"","Link Target":""}],"Related Topics Blurb":"","Related Topics Link Target":[""]}

{"title":"Interviews","id":13697501,"template":"Standard Page","folder":"Job Application Tips","status":"Content Revisions","Page Title":"Interviews","Page Description":"","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p>Once your resume or application has caught the attention of an employer, you may be asked to meet for a formal interview. The key to any successful interview is preparing ahead of time. Use the following interview tips or watch the video below to help you get ready.<\/p><h2>BEFORE THE INTERVIEW<\/h2><h4>Research the organization<\/h4><p>Employers want to know that you did your homework for the interview. Show your potential boss that your skills and values align with the company\u2019s interests. Learn what they do, who they serve, what makes their business different from their competitors and how long they\u2019ve been in business.<\/p><h4>Research the job<\/h4><p>By knowing all the requirements for the position\u2014such as the industry-standard skills, tasks and education\u2014you can show the interviewer how your experience makes you qualified. If an employer requests, \u201cequivalent education or experience,\u201d consider referencing non-professional experiences that fit the qualifications. (For example, if a job posting asks for leadership skills, you might describe your three years as a volunteer coach for a youth soccer team.)<\/p><h4>Prepare for common interview questions<\/h4><p>It\u2019s difficult to prepare for every question, but you can build your confidence by practising common questions beforehand. The following resources are a great starting point:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ubc.ca\/okanagan\/hr\/__shared\/assets\/Common_Behavioural_Interview_Questions23153.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Common Behavioural Interview Questions \u2013 UBC<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www2.gov.bc.ca\/gov\/content\/careers-myhr\/all-employees\/career-development\/competencies-in-the-bc-public-service\/interviews-hiring\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Competency-Based Interview Questions \u2013 BC Public Service<\/a><\/li><\/ul><p>You may also want to ask a friend or a family member to help you with a mock interview. Practise answering potential interview questions in a familiar environment; you will feel more comfortable and confident in the real interview. Plus, repetition will help train your brain for the real event.<\/p><h4>Prepare questions for the interviewer<\/h4><p>By preparing a few questions beforehand, you not only show your potential employer you\u2019re interested, but it also helps you figure out if this is the right job for you. You can ask questions about the work environment, the daily tasks or even about the company.<\/p><h4>Arrive a few minutes early<\/h4><p>Research the location of the interview, check your commute time or the bus route, and leave early to ensure you arrive just before your scheduled interview time.<\/p><h2>AT THE INTERVIEW<\/h2><p>In many cases, you\u2019ll compete with several candidates for the job. How you present yourself will affect your chances of success.<\/p><h4>Dress to impress<\/h4><p>Dress one step above the regular dress code\u2014for example, if you\u2019re applying to a work environment with a uniform or a casual dress code, wear business casual. Likewise, if you\u2019re applying to work at an office with a strict business casual policy, wear business clothes (a suit or dress suit combo). Although professional business fashion changes over time, it\u2019s better to slightly overdress and put in the effort, rather than appear underdressed for the interview.<br\/><br\/><strong>Note:<\/strong> If you don\u2019t have professional interview clothes, there are several community organizations that can provide you with an outfit. Programs such as <a href=\"https:\/\/vancouver.dressforsuccess.org\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dress for Success<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/workinggear.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Working Gear<\/a> are just a few organizations that offer this service. If you can\u2019t find one near you, contact your local <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13140638\" >WorkBC Centre<\/a> to learn more about the resources available in your community.<\/p><h4>Show the interviewer you\u2019re engaged and interested<\/h4><p>You can demonstrate engagement through a variety of methods: making polite small talk you\u2019re your potential employer before the interview, smiling, making eye contact, and taking the time to thoughtfully respond to their questions. Engage with the employer through active listening (to hear and understand the speaker), which will help you avoid miscommunication and other common interview errors. Read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/career-advice\/career-development\/active-listening-skills\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Active Listening Skills: Definition and Examples<\/a> to learn more.<\/p><h4>Ask questions<\/h4><p>When prompted near the end, use the available time to \u201cinterview\u201d the employer. Be sure to ask at least one or two relevant questions about the job or company\u2014it shows you\u2019re interested!<\/p><h4>Bring your references\u2019 contact information<\/h4><p>Sometimes a potential employer will request your references at the end of an interview, so always come prepared. However, it\u2019s standard courtesy to notify your references before you give their information to your interviewer or potential employer.<\/p><h2>AFTER THE INTERVIEW<\/h2><h4>Send a thank-you email<\/h4><p>In addition to expressing your appreciation for the interview, a thank-you email brings that personal aspect to the job selection process. Being friendly, polite and professional goes a long way when applying for a job. A thank-you note is typically sent within a day or two of your interview.<\/p><h4>Reflect on the process<\/h4><p>Job interviews are difficult, and, like any new skill, it takes time to learn. Even if you weren\u2019t the successful candidate, it was still a valuable opportunity to practise your interview skills and network with the company\u2014and it\u2019s always possible that the employer may remember you and invite you to apply for a new opportunity in the future.<\/p><h4>Learn more<\/h4><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13140638\" >WorkBC Centres<\/a> have useful career resources that can help you prepare for an interview.

In some regions, that percentage is higher. Networking is a vital way to identify work opportunities and connect with potential employers in the \u201chidden\u201d job market.<\/p><p>Your current social circle, both online and offline, is a good place to start to expand your network of acquaintances, but you\u2019ll find other excellent networking opportunities listed below. Whatever networking strategies you employ, expanding your network will expand your prospects.<\/p><h4>Networking for career development<\/h4><p><strong>Volunteer \u2014 <\/strong>This is a fine method for broadening your network and allowing prospective employers to discover your abilities. You can gain experience, make connections, demonstrate your skills and get noticed. Volunteering provides an opportunity for word to spread about your talents and availability. And sometimes paid employment grows directly out of volunteer activities.<\/p><p><strong>Join a job club \u2014 <\/strong>For those who are eligible, job clubs have many advantages: you quickly find out you are not alone, discover which job-search methods that are working for people, and gain a built-in network of people who know people. Someone in the job club may have a friend or relative looking for a landscaper, which may be your job target. You never know when an opportunity could present itself.<\/p><p><strong>Find groups in your area(s) of interest \u2014 <\/strong>Join a new group to build your network. If you like computers and are passionate about programming, find a programming user group. Such groups allow you to build lasting, mutually helpful professional relationships. As you become connected, you\u2019ll likely discover career opportunities.<\/p><p>If you don\u2019t know how to find a group, you can use a search engine like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meetup<\/a> to find groups in your field and community. For example, search \"Programming user group Penticton.\"<\/p><p><strong>Tell community groups you are a part of \u2014 <\/strong>Organizations you are already part of may have many members, some of whom already know you well. Talk to them about your career or job-search goals. If people don\u2019t know that you\u2019re looking for work, then they can\u2019t share any opportunities with you.<\/p><p><strong>Social media networking \u2014 <\/strong>These days, social media is an excellent method for connecting with employers and job opportunities. Find out more about using social media in your job search below.<\/p><p><strong>Attend job fairs \u2014 <\/strong>Job fairs are another great opportunity to connect with people: employers who are seeking workers, employment service providers and other job seekers. Even if a company isn\u2019t looking for someone with your background, they may know of someone else who is. They may be happy to pass on your resume or keep it for their own future needs. Be proactive and do some homework on the companies you plan to approach at the job fair (participating companies are usually listed in advance event notices). Your obvious interest and preparation will increase your chances of winning an interview.<\/p><p><\/p><p>When networking, always thank the people who have given you advice or contacts by emailing or mailing them a thank-you note. Networking is all about building relationships.

And now that Trevor is trained as an aquaculture technician and on the job with Grieg Seafood Ltd., he gets all the time on the water he could have imagined.<\/p><p>Living in the tiny community of Tsaxana, near Gold River, back in 2012, Trevor set his sights on a career in aquaculture. To get there, he signed up for the Aquaculture Technician Diploma Program being offered in his home community by Excel Career College.

It helped me learn how to deal with end-of-day logs and databases such as environment conditions.\u201d<\/p><p>Trevor got a practicum placement with Grieg Seafood during the program and his commitment to do well really shone through.

Whether you use Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, it\u2019s important to spread the word that you\u2019re looking for work. <br\/><br\/>If you don\u2019t let anyone know that you\u2019re searching for jobs, then the potential to network and advertise your skills is wasted. The next time you\u2019re on your favourite social media site, make sure you let your friends and followers know that you\u2019re looking for a job. Your friends may not know of any immediate job openings, but if any come up, they\u2019ll definitely think of you if they know you\u2019re looking. <br\/><br\/>Social media is all about spreading the word, so be sure to spread your message as far as possible.<\/p><h4>Create a professional profile<\/h4><p>Many employers are now using social media to help screen potential hires, so if you applied for a job recently, there\u2019s a good chance that your profile has been looked at by someone in the company you applied to. <\/p><p>For this reason, it\u2019s very important that you tidy your online profiles by removing any questionable photos or messages before you start looking for work. It\u2019s also a good idea to replace your profile picture with one that shows your professionalism and good taste. <\/p><p><\/p><p>If you\u2019d prefer to keep your profile private, make sure that you update the privacy settings on any of the sites you use to ensure that only your friends can view your content.<\/p><h4>\u201cFollow\u201d or \u201clike\u201d career experts<\/h4><p>One of the great things about social media is how quickly you can access the latest job-search advice and trends. Sites like Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and LinkedIn are teeming with recruiters, bloggers, career counsellors and HR personnel who are eager to share their expertise with job seekers. <\/p><p>Whether it\u2019s an infographic, blog post, article or study, you\u2019ll find plenty of useful information and tips on social media that can help you land your dream job. The next time you go online, make sure you devote some time to follow the experts or companies in your field of interest.<\/p><h4>Make connections<\/h4><p>Due in part to the marketing potential of social media and its growing user base, many employers are now using social media as a way to spread company news, job postings, and promotions. <\/p><p>And because it\u2019s so fast and easy to spread the word through social media, many employers are now announcing job opportunities on their social media feeds long before they post them on job boards or newspapers. For this reason, it\u2019s important to connect with employers online to make sure you don\u2019t miss out on any opportunities.

If that sounds familiar, you are not alone. Career exploration and planning can be an overwhelming task. Teens often get stressed and afraid to make a decision. \"What If \u2026 I don\u2019t like it \u2026 What If \u2026 it ends up not being what I want to do \u2026 What If \u2026 I can\u2019t find a job afterwards \u2026 What if \u2026 they worried for nothing!\u201d <br\/><br\/>Education and training is a valuable investment in yourself, as the transferrable skills and experience gained will be useful throughout your life and career journey.<br\/><br\/>For some teens, an end goal is needed in order to focus and get it done. For others, taking it year-by-year may be a better approach, which keeps them focused in the moment and not getting overwhelmed with what\u2019s next. It also allows for more achievable goals. This could look like enrolling in a program that offers stages of completion, such as certificate for the first year, diploma for second year, and degree upon completion of the 3rd and 4th years.<br\/><br\/>The <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14866288\" >WorkBC Parents\u2019 Guide <\/a>is a great resource for getting the conversation and journey started.

Build on their interests by exploring all options that could be a fit. For instance, just because they like animals does not mean they have to be a veterinarian \u2013 they can become an advocate or lawyer for animal rights. <br\/><br\/><strong>Remember:  <\/strong><em>Don\u2019t focus on the destination, enjoy the journey.

Schooled in geography and gardening, the 37 year old Vancouver Island woman was starting to doubt that she\u2019d ever have a career in ecological or sustainable\/edible landscaping. \u201cI was unemployed,\u201d says Erin, \u201cand I didn\u2019t know what the heck I would do.\u201d<\/p><p>Katie Gateley was in almost the same boat. Having recently moved to the Cowichan Valley, she was having a tough time finding a job that had anything to do with her education and skills.<\/p><p>And then both women found something interesting online- an intriguing job posting by the Cowichan Green Community Society. The non-profit, which focuses on environmental sustainability in the Cowichan region, was looking to design and create a demonstration food forest. To make this happen, it had teamed up with the B.C. Government to hire workers through a Job Creation Partnership.<\/p><p>Interested, Erin and Katie each visited the local WorkBC Employment Services Centre, where they got a lot of help. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised with the amount of resources and support that were offered,\u201d says Katie.<\/p><p>Both women were encouraged to apply for positions with the project and were stoked to get hired. \u201cI could hardly believe that I was getting the chance to learn about food forest concepts and about all the edible plants that we can grow in our area,\u201d Erin says. \u201cI have worked in a lot of gardens, but this one has so many plants that aren\u2019t in typical ornamental landscaping.\u201d<\/p><p>The Cowichan Green Community Society is a hub for social innovation and community engagement in the Cowichan Valley. They wanted to create the edible garden to demonstrate food forestry and permaculture principles. The idea was to plant more than 500 perennial food plants, from goji berries to Seabuck and from Stevia to mulberries, and to use creative techniques for water catchment to make the whole thing sustainable.<\/p><p>Erin and Katie got two of the coolest jobs you can imagine, working to transform the grounds of a former motel. And the best thing about it was that it led to lasting employment for both women. Once the 24-week project was done, the society hired Erin to directly apply what she had learned through its Ceres Edible Landscaping operation. Katie also got a position organizing and running Cowichan Green Community\u2019s new KinPark Kid\u2019s Summer Camp.<br\/>WorkBC came through for Katie and Erin, with funding for the Job Creation Partnership and with the help of the WorkBC Employment Services Centre that helped them make the connection and get their jobs.<\/p><p>Katie is grateful for the opportunity. She says, \u201cI learned more than I could ever have imagined in the span of six months, and I will carry this knowledge forward with confidence, spreading the word about sustainable agriculture, community building and positive relationships with food.\u201d<\/p><p>Erin is also thrilled with the experience and with working for Cowichan Green Community. \u201cIt provides a living example of how innovation, creativity and positive attitudes can function as a way to be while at work,\u201d says Erin. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, where things are changing so fast, I think it is a very valuable skill to innovate and create new ideas. Furthermore, while you are gaining work experience, it feels so great to know you are also contributing to your community\u2019s well-being.\u201d<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"A Job Creation Partnership program helped Erin and Katie enhance their skillsets and land work."}

Sometimes, even the most qualified candidates do not progress past the int\u00ad\u00aderview stage to receive a job offer because they underperformed. Since most interviews have a structured format, they tend to include a set of standard or common questions. Being as well-prepared as possible for interview questions can help you receive a job offer.<br\/><br\/><strong>The 'Tell Me About Yourself' Question: <\/strong>This common first question should not take you by surprise. A great response would include a summary of your background, which means everything that you think is important for the hiring manager to know. Some good topics are your education, work experience, career goals and personal interests that might be related to the position. The same elevator speech can be used for <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13697504\" >networking<\/a>.<br\/><br\/><strong>Questions About You & Your Experience: <\/strong>These questions can revolve around your strengths and weaknesses, job-specific skills and work experiences. These types of questions are also aimed at evaluating your past behaviour when faced with challenging situations at work. Examples of those situations would be time management\/task prioritization issues, working on complex projects and dealing with a difficult teammate or client. Answering these questions with a specific example from your work history in a story telling manner and stating some of the lessons you learned from the situation would make for an optimal and memorable response. <\/p><p><strong><em>Examples:<\/em><\/strong><em> <\/em><\/p><ul><li><em>What do you think is your biggest professional achievement?<\/em><\/li><li><em>Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership skills?<\/em><\/li><li><em>What are your career goals for the next 10 years?<\/em><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Company Question: <\/strong>This type of question is intended to determine your interest in the position, the organization and how you may be a good fit for the company.

{"title":"Ready to Work? Landing Your First Part-Time Job","id":14865114,"template":"Blog Post, News Post, Success Stories Post","folder":"Blog","status":"Content Revisions","Page Title":"Ready to Work? Landing Your First Part-Time Job","Date":"9 April 2018","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p>Having no previous work experience may seem like a significant barrier to employment, but everyone has to start somewhere and embark on their first job. Potential employers use a record of work experience as one of the main predictors of your future performance, and without it, your resume is likely to fade out when placed next to competition.<br\/><br\/>A few years ago, I had difficulties landing my first part-time work, and felt discouraged after sending copies of resume and never hearing back. I imagined getting a part-time job as something easy and was surprised by having little to no responses. After a while, the realization that my efforts clearly yield no result prompted me to change my job hunting strategy.<br\/><br\/>Below are the steps I took to make my job search more effective and key takeaways from these experiences:<br\/><br\/><strong>1. Evaluated my skills, resume and experience:<\/strong>  Just by skimming through my resume it became evident that, besides academics and some volunteering experience, my resume did not have much to offer. All the transferrable skills listed were not supported by relevant experiences, which made it unconvincing and dull. Another major weakness of my resume and candidacy was a lack of the most sought after skill for the positions that I was applying for. I was seeking a job in retail because many part-time student jobs are in the retail sector, however, I did not possess the customer service experience that employers need.<br\/><br\/><strong><em>Key Takeaway:<\/em><\/strong> <\/p><ul><li>Looking at your qualifications and resume through the employer\u2019s perspective helps to identify areas of improvement and focus on what you should be working on.<br\/><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>2. Volunteer experience: <\/strong>I was determined to make the most of my time and started searching for volunteering positions. Volunteering is not only a great opportunity to help others, it also give you a chance to gain new experiences and challenge yourself, as well as meet new people and gain valuable skills. Volunteering roles helped me grow professionally, personally and helped me to gain confidence that I would be an effective and valuable employee in the future.<br\/><br\/><strong><em>Key takeaway:<\/em><\/strong> <\/p><ul><li>Paid work is not the only way to develop transferrable skills and gain experience.<br\/><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>3. Searching online strategically:<\/strong> To increase my chances of being selected I started searching for jobs on different job boards and applied to several employers. I also applied to jobs outside the search parameters of my favourite brands and apparel. I put a lot of effort into customizing my resume and d cover letters, which I sent even if they were optional.<br\/><br\/><strong><em>Key takeaways:<\/em><\/strong><\/p><ul><li>Being too selective limits your job choices and new opportunities may arise when you leave your comfort zone.<\/li><li>Quality of your application package <strong>AND<\/strong> quantity of applications you send both play role in probability of you being hired.<\/li><\/ul><p><\/p><p>By developing a job search strategy I quickly landed my first part-time job.<br\/><br\/><strong><em>Main Takeaway:<\/em><\/strong> <\/p><ul><li>Job seekers need to strategically develop a job search to achieve their employment goals.<br\/><\/li><\/ul><p>Learn more:<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13697497\" >Job Application Tips<\/a> \u2013 resume tips and more!<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Jobs-Careers\/Find-Jobs\/Jobs.aspx\" >WorkBC Job Board<\/a> \u2013 browse our job postings database and apply today!<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13697507\" >Know Your Rights As a Job Applicant<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/12593178\" >Workplace Rights<\/a><\/li><\/ul><p><\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Learn how to land your first part-time job."}

Sandra, who ran the day to day operations, started out as an employee and jokes that she liked the company so much that she bought it.<\/p><p>Although the world was in a recession, the oil and gas industry was expanding. By 2010, Action Health & Safety, which supplies the oil patch in northeastern B.C. and northwestern Alberta with first aid, emergency care and security services, had a 250 per cent profit increase. Action Health increased the number of oil and gas units serviced from 12 to 40. It became one of Profit 100\u2019s fastest growing Canadian companies and the sisters were named in the top 25 entrepreneurs in Canada in 2010 and 2011.<\/p><p>When asked how they\u2019ve done so well in the male dominated field of oil and gas, Sandra says it\u2019s a non-issue. \u201cShelley and I have always worked in male dominant fields and as far as we\u2019re concerned, people are people and business is business. We are successful because we are experts in our field and people respect that.\u201d<\/p><p>Shelley was largely a silent partner until 2012 when circumstances forced her to take over; Sandra was diagnosed with cancer. \u201cIt was one of those life changing moments that led to a lot of soul searching,\u201d Sandra recounts. \u201cWe had many discussions about the future and work life balance.\u201d<\/p><p>As a result they scaled back to make the business more manageable. \u201cIt\u2019s now the right size so that Sandra and I can easily run things,\u201d Shelley explains.<\/p><p>Although Health & Safety provides stable employment to 30 employees and many more contract workers in the oil patch.

Are you interested in working for the government?<br\/><br\/>After graduating high school, I went to the University of Victoria and was pre-accepted to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uvic.ca\/gustavson\/\" >Peter B. Gustavson School of Business<\/a> program, specializing in Entrepreneurship. Since then I have completed my third year and gone to Krakow, Poland for a semester long exchange. However, to graduate from the program you must have completed three co-operative experiences between semesters. Completing a previous co-op, I recognized I wanted to gain experience in a large corporation. This is where I found the Client Engagement Unit Co-op opportunity at the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training.<br\/><br\/>Working for the government can be challenging. For example, there are many acronyms that are used in daily conversations. However, there are three overall benefits that I experienced as a co-op for WorkBC.ca:<\/p><ol><li><strong>Great Support Systems: <\/strong>Having a good relationship with your supervisor is important for a great co-op experience. One strategy that my supervisor implemented is having weekly meetings. My supervisor could check up on my work and skill development and I could ask questions or concerns that I had on current or upcoming projects.<\/li><li><strong>Large Opportunity to Grow: <\/strong>The government as a whole is a very large organization. As a co-op student I was able to work on projects that don\u2019t necessarily land under my job description but allowed further skill development. For example I was able to conduct research on multiple projects, moderate social media comments and implement new processes by discovering and using innovative technology that helped my colleagues moderate more efficiently as well. Because the government is a large organization you are able to participate on projects that are outside your job description and develop your skills further.<\/li><li><strong>The Greater Purpose: <\/strong>Working for the B.C. Public Service is extremely rewarding. Working on WorkBC.ca helps British Columbians successfully navigate B.C\u2019s job market. WorkBC.ca helps people find jobs, explore career options and improve their skills. We also help employers fill vacancies, find the right employee and grow their business. This is a lot of responsibility, but because your projects support this greater purpose you gain a sense of pride and motivation when completing a new task.<\/li><\/ol><p>Before I joined the Ministry, I had little experience in large corporate settings. Coming to an office that has more than 100 people within a building was intimidating, but I was excited for the opportunity to learn the processes. This co-op experience allowed me to recognize what a large organization can accomplish. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a more worthwhile and skill development experience. I encourage others to learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14611762\" >co-op education opportunities<\/a> so you too gain relevant experience before graduation.<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Interested in learning about the benefits of a co-operative education?

But by the time I completed the second year of a Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Victoria, I felt burned out. I had learned a lot, but felt lost when it came to my career path. I took classes that were interesting, but could not understand how these courses applied to my professional future. I made the big decision to take a year off from my studies. After sorting out the logistics, my career counsellor recommended that I complete a co-op during my year off to gain some professional skills and experience while getting a break from school. It turns out that this recommendation was an excellent idea.<br\/><br\/>This past Fall I was fortunate to land a position with the Client Engagement Unit (CEU) in the Ministry of Advanced Education Skills & Training. For me it was the perfect fit. The CEU is responsible for maintaining and updating the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/\" >WorkBC.ca<\/a> website while also marketing the resources through social media and outreach events to provide valuable resources to job seekers and employers across the province. With the CEU, I have been able to broaden my practical knowledge of digital marketing while also gaining valuable experience on the job.<br\/><br\/>There were a lot of things that I expected out of a co-op\u2014such as gaining professional work experience, meeting influential people, learning about an industry first hand, and getting a taste for what type of work I enjoyed. Yet, there were a lot of things I didn\u2019t expect. Firstly, my employer was very open to me taking on tasks that were aligned with my interests so that I could build skills in areas that mattered most to me. My supervisors were also very supportive of continuous learning. I participated in many seminars and meetings that gave me the unique opportunity to learn new skills and information. There was amazing support for co-op students from different schools and educational backgrounds in the BC Public Service Agency (BCPSA) to meet and get to know each other. The opportunity to network and share experiences and perspectives with other co-op students was very valuable to my career development. <br\/> <br\/>In the past four months of my co-op term I learned so much more than I expected. Previously I couldn\u2019t have imagined myself working for the BCPSA. Now I have a whole new perspective on what the BCPSA does for British Columbians. I truly enjoyed being a part of the team working to help support British Columbians throughout the province. I leave my BCPSA co-op placement more inspired about my professional future than I have ever been before. I encourage others to look into co-op opportunities at their university, and learn more on the <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14611762\" >WorkBC Co-op<\/a> page. <\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Learn about Skyler's educational journey and why he decided to complete a co-op term with the Client Engagement Unit."}

We have a ridiculous number of long term staff,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cSome have been with Accent Inns for 20, 30 years \u2013 which is unheard of in the hotel business.\u201d<\/p><p>When she travels to any of the six properties she can reel off stories. \u201cI know these people, I knew when they were pregnant, now their kids are working for us. People take care of each other. We encourage that. We\u2019re looking out for each other.\u201d<\/p><p>Like many tourism-related businesses the economic downturn in 2008\/ 2009 was very challenging. \u201cWe really had to sharpen our pencils. We focused on brand awareness. We are a small chain and we are constantly up against the big boys,\u201d she says referring to international chains.<\/p><p>Accent Inns is tiny by comparison. \u201cHow do we compete with that? We didn\u2019t have the marketing budget. So we decided to make sure every customer\u2019s experience is excellent so those customers tell other people. It was a ground level campaign. We have to make sure our customers spread the word for us because we don\u2019t have marketing dollars.\u201d <\/p><p>Though she grew up in the business, her first job wasn\u2019t in the family firm. She started out as a chamber maid at a local bed & breakfast.<\/p><p>Advice to someone who is just starting out in the business: \u201cYou really have to think outside the box and apply innovation to our industry. I feel the hotel industry is lacking innovation. There is ample, ample opportunity to innovate and capture attention.\u201d<\/p><p>That\u2019s what she\u2019s doing with the Hotel Zed concept in Victoria. It\u2019s the first of what could be a brand new chain for Accent.

Usually they\u2019ll say somewhere trendy, competitive, and most of the time, they\u2019ll be envisioning a private firm. Often, they see private firms as the main hub of innovative, fast-paced, and rewarding work, such as Google and Tesla \u2013 two organizations that have created unique solutions to tackle daily problems. Rarely do they picture the provincial government as competing in the same league.<br\/> <br\/>Although government employment is largely associated with stability and exceptional benefits, it is often perceived by many Millennials and Generation Zs as less exciting work than in the private sector. In fact, after reaching out to several business and economic students, it became clear that working in the provincial government is often seen as slow-paced and mundane. But after completing a co-op with the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training (AEST), I am here to debunk the myths regarding government employment! <\/p><p>A little about myself \u2013 my name is Karissa and I am fourth year commerce student attending the University of Victoria. Prior to my recent co-op with the provincial government, I had spent my time working exclusively in the private sector. I found the work to be rewarding and exciting and at the time, would have been happy to pursue the remainder of my career in the sector. However, after seeing a posting for a position with the provincial government, I thought I would take a chance \u2013 if anything, to reaffirm my beliefs about what it would be like to work in government, slow and mundane. And yet, I was happily surprised to learn that many of the perceptions I held were false. Listed below are several of the common myths about working in government debunked.<br\/><br\/><strong><em>Myth: Working for the government is slow-paced.<\/em><\/strong><br\/><em>If I could describe the teams working within the provincial government, it would be small yet mighty. Quite often, individuals are juggling multiple tasks at once to ensure goals are met. Working in government allowed me to improve my project and time management skills to fit in all of my required tasks prior to the end of my employment. Although people are busy, they are happy to be there and have a strong sense of pride with respect to the work they do.<\/em><br\/> <br\/><strong><em>Myth: Innovation only takes place in the private sector.<\/em><\/strong><br\/><em>According to the 2016 corporate plan, the provincial government has been actively working towards changing its culture to better deliver services to British Columbians. To create innovative solutions to the complex problems faced by citizens, the organization is shifting its culture to become increasingly experimental, collaborative and people focused. This mindset has been adopted by many employees. In fact, I found many of my colleagues and supervisors constantly asking for new perspectives and ideas on how they could change previously established processes.<\/em><br\/> <br\/><strong><em>Myth: I\u2019ll never be able to advance my career in government.<\/em><\/strong><br\/><em>During my co-op, I enjoyed asking people about their employment history \u2013 curious as to what landed them a spot working for the provincial government. By listening to many different stories, I found one overarching theme \u2013 almost all employees had moved both vertically and horizontally within the provincial government. And many employees had previously worked for several different ministries and held roles in various positions. As someone who doesn't stay in one place for long and enjoys partaking in different projects, this was exciting to learn. Furthermore, with a projected gap in government employees due to the retirement of the baby boomer generation, it can be expected that the ease of horizontal and vertical movement will increase \u2013 allowing for even more opportunities in the future.<\/em><br\/> <br\/><strong><em>Myth: Lack of workplace culture.<\/em><\/strong><br\/><em>To say that the workplace culture of the provincial government is diverse is an understatement. Employees are of all ages, from undergraduate students to individuals approaching retirement. Employees come from all different cultural and employment backgrounds. This makes for exciting meetings as there are varying understandings and solutions brought to the table. The opportunity to serve fellow British Columbians acts as a key motivator for most provincial employees. Never before in my employment experiences had I seen employees refer to their work as a privilege and not a job. I found this to be genuinely inspiring.<\/em><br\/> <br\/>So, if you\u2019re contemplating working in the public sector, I say give it shot \u2013 you might be pleasantly surprised by your experience, just as I was!<br\/> <br\/>To find out more about the benefits of cooperative education and to see if it\u2019s for you, check out<br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14611762\" >www.workbc.ca\/coop<\/a><\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Four myths about working for government explained."}

{"title":"My Co-op Experience","id":14865084,"template":"Blog Post, News Post, Success Stories Post","folder":"Blog","status":"Content Revisions","Page Title":"My Co-op Experience","Date":"28 June 2019","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p>As a fourth-year Bachelor of Commerce student at the University of Victoria, I was fortunate enough to participate in an academic exchange in Bangkok, Thailand. Mid-way through my exchange, I was struck with the realization that it was time to start searching for a co-op position to complement my return to Canada. <br\/><br\/>After a few hard weeks of applying and interviewing, I was offered a position as a client engagement analyst with the Client Engagement Unit (CEU) in the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. Our team is responsible for creating and updating content on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/\" > WorkBC.ca<\/a> while marketing the website\u2019s resources through social media and outreach events.<br\/><br\/>Throughout my co-op term, I worked alongside a very supportive team that truly wanted me to learn as much as possible during my time with them. I completed a handful of projects and assisted with social media, all while traveling across beautiful British Columbia delivering labour market information at events.<br\/><br\/><strong><em>The Skills that this Co-op Strengthened<\/em><\/strong><br\/>During my experience with the CEU, I strengthened countless transferable skills that will help me in my future career. The most notable skills I gained were:<br\/><br\/><strong>Communication \u2013 <\/strong>This skill has many different definitions, but for me, it means being able to translate information to others and being able to understand what information you are given. Co-op is a time to learn, so I was always trying to take in as much information as I could, drawing on my active listening skills. On the other hand, some of the projects I worked on involved heavy logistics that required me to organize shipping and invoicing with university partners across the province. Being exposed to these types of responsibilities increased my confidence not only as a professional, but as a person in general.<br\/><br\/><strong>Public Speaking \u2013 <\/strong>Public speaking had always been a skill I possessed, but a lot of my public speaking experience was a result of my four years at university. I had always been able to memorize a speech and present it without any problems. Unfortunately, public speaking in a non-university setting is much different. There were no rehearsals for the outreach events I attended, and I never knew what to expect before going to an event. My experience with the CEU gave me the confidence to speak publicly without memorization and rehearsing \u2013 a skill that school alone does not teach you.<br\/><br\/><strong>Planning and Organization \u2013 <\/strong>Juggling projects between travelling for events was difficult at times, but it taught me to constantly set small deadlines for myself for what I wanted to have completed before each travel date. Sometimes those deadlines were accomplished, and sometimes they were not. However, co-op is about learning. Being given the opportunity to enhance my planning skills in the workplace as a student was extremely valuable.<br\/> <br\/><strong><em>Interested in Co-op?<\/em><\/strong><br\/>My top three suggestions for landing a co-op are:<\/p><ol><li>Connect with your post-secondary institution\u2019s career office to locate a potential online job board. They likely connect with employers every semester to search for co-op opportunities for their students. Don\u2019t be scared! Go speak with your career office to see if they can connect you to some potential co-op opportunities in your area.<\/li><li>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Jobs-Careers\/Find-Jobs\/Jobs.aspx\" >WorkBC.ca Job Board<\/a> to find opportunities throughout the province and applying online. There are two key words you must know to find a co-op position on the WorkBC Job Board. The first being \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Jobs-Careers\/Find-Jobs\/Jobs.aspx?keywords=co-op\" >co-op<\/a>\u201d, and the second being \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Jobs-Careers\/Find-Jobs\/Jobs.aspx?keywords=Intern\" >intern<\/a>.\u201d<\/li><li>Network your way to a co-op! Connect with the employers that you have an interest working with and ask them about any potential opportunities. If opportunities are available, try to leverage a coffee meeting with an employee in the company to increase your chances of obtaining the position.<\/li><\/ol><p><strong><em>More on Co-op?<\/em><\/strong><br\/>Graduating without any work experience can make the transition into a full-time career difficult, as many job postings ask for both a degree and work experience. Thankfully, enrolling in a co-op term helped me gain valuable experience that I can use when applying for future employment. It can help you too!<br\/>If you are interested in learning more about co-op, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14611762\" >WorkBC\u2019s Co-op Overview<\/a>.

Her face heated as she realized she\u2019d spoken up in a room with well over a hundred people. She\u2019d been quietly listening to a panelist discussion at the Women in Trades Conference, but when someone asked about the success rate of the Industry Training Authority (ITA) <a href=\"http:\/\/youth.itabc.ca\/programs\/train\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Youth Train in Trades Program<\/a> (formerly ACE-IT), Cressen knew she had to speak up.<br\/><br\/>Cressen is incredibly passionate about the Youth Train in Trades program, as she describes the career she now enjoys because of it. She\u2019s proud to not only be working for the Surrey School District, but also for being recognized as the first female carpenter hired by them. Cressen found the program helped her discover her own path and, at the age of 22, she enjoys an established career.<br\/><br\/>Cressen credits a large part of her success to her teachers and would like to acknowledge all those who helped her along the journey of becoming the person she is today.<br\/><br\/>\u201cThe teachers are both passionate and compassionate about what they do. I honestly would not be here today without them! If you are struggling with a concept, they will take the time to help you figure it out before moving on to the next step.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Cressen doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to sharing tips about her success. She wants youth considering trades to know what it takes to succeed. She encourages young adults\u2014especially young women\u2014by letting them know they\u2019re capable of enjoying the type of success she\u2019s experienced, \u201cI\u2019ve walked onto a jobsite as the only female among 150 men.

Her father, a gas fitter and a plumber, often brought her along on side jobs and gave her the opportunity to help. \u201cAlso, he didn\u2019t want to hire a babysitter,\u201d she adds with a laugh.<br\/><br\/>Cressen is clear proof that seizing unfamiliar opportunities can help aid both your career and personal development. In the process, the mentoring she received influenced her decision to volunteer with ITA, and now she\u2019s paying it forward with advice to others.

If so, an informational interview over a cup of coffee might be the right opportunity for you!<br\/><br\/>But who do you approach about an interview and what\u2019s the importance of it being over a cup of coffee? Read the questions and matching answers below to find out!<br\/> <\/p><ol><li><strong> Why request an informational interview?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>If you are uncertain about pursuing a career or taking a job with a company and want more information, requesting an informational interview is a great start. These types of interviews allow for no-strings-attached conversations between a job seeker and a working professional.<br\/> <\/p><ol><li><strong> Who should the interview be with?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>The interview should be between yourself and a working professional. The working professional should be someone who works with your prospective company (possibly the prospective supervisor), holds a role in a position that you hope to secure, and\/or is an established professional in the industry. Individuals in these roles will often be more equipped to handle any questions you may have due to their first-hand experiences.<br\/> <\/p><ol><li><strong> Why should the interview be over coffee?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>There are several reasons why informational interviews conducted over a cup of coffee are effective. First, working professionals are often very busy and have little time to meet. Therefore, professionals will be more incentivized to attend an informational interview if it is at the same time as their breaks, to minimize time away from work. Furthermore, grabbing a cup of coffee is naturally informal. This leads people to feel less stressed and anxious as opposed to formal interviews in offices. Moreover, holding a cup of coffee gives your hands something to do, preventing you from fidgeting. And coffee gives us energy, which leads to more talking and therefore deeper conversations!<br\/> <\/p><ol><li><strong>How do you reach out to a working professional?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>To contact a working professional, simply send them an email. To retrieve their email, check the company website or lookup their LinkedIn profile. Emails should be short and to the point with a specific request. They should provide an exact time frame regarding the length of the meeting, as well as a location that is convenient for the working professional.<br\/> <\/p><ol><li><strong> How do you prepare for the interview?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p>To ensure that benefits from the interview are maximized, you should research the professional, the company they work for, as well as create a list of potential interview questions. In brief, everything learned from the interview should be information that could not be located online.<br\/> <br\/>The following questions serve as samples as to what could be asked in an interview:<\/p><ul><li>What skills are important for this role?<\/li><li>How would you describe the company culture?<\/li><li>What was your inspiration to enter the field of ___?<\/li><li>How can I differentiate myself from others in the field?<\/li><\/ul><ol><li><strong> How do you follow-up after an interview?<\/strong><\/li><\/ol><p><em>Very<\/em> <em>Important<\/em> \u2013 Within 24 hours of completing the interview, it is good form to send a follow-up email to the interviewee, thanking them for their time and advice. This will further help you build a relationship with the individual.<br\/> <br\/>Learn more by visiting the <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13697497\" >Job Application Tips<\/a> page.<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Why an informational interview over a cup of coffee might be the right opportunity for you!"}

Read the Q&A below to learn about Hazel\u2019s story, and read her best piece of advice.<\/p><p><strong>How did you get your start?<\/strong><br\/>Sometimes things just fall in your lap, and the rest they say is history! I had a remarkable opportunity 25 years ago to take a six-week Women\u2019s Career Advancement training program through the government (I had been a stay-at-home mom with my girls). While I was taking the course, the owner of the school saw that I was always buzzing around helping the other students and asked if I would like to work for them.<br\/> <br\/>My first gig was as a helper for a computer training and ESL [English as a Second Language] course, but my big break came when I started working as a job club facilitator. I trained under a dear colleague and friend, and ended up working there for about three years. I then started burning out on the group work, not sure if I could do it any longer. But as luck would have it, the same woman who had mentored me for the job club was now doing employment consulting and suggested I try that instead. As it turned out, the one-on-one work was a better fit for me. Now, 25 years later, here I still am!<br\/><br\/><strong>What is it like to work at a WorkBC Centre?<\/strong><br\/>Our workplace is quite remarkable, and our staff members are very welcoming. It\u2019s a happy place to work and I\u2019m very thankful for that.<br\/> <br\/>I encourage [other coworkers] to be real with the clients, kind, welcoming and gracious. We are blessed to be working, and we have a unique opportunity to really make a difference in someone\u2019s life.<br\/><br\/><strong>What\u2019s your favourite part of your job?<\/strong><br\/>I get to chat with people! I meet with clients, spend time assessing what\u2019s going on in their life, figure out how WorkBC, and the various programs and resources, can assist. I like helping people, whether that\u2019s here at work or at home or in the community. For a funny story\u2014my husband found a book called <em>Hazel the Helpful Fairy<\/em> and it\u2019s pretty much my story (although she was a squirrel!).<br\/><br\/><strong>How do you help others with career planning?<\/strong><br\/>I like to use some of the traditional assessments, like interest inventories and personality tests. They can help give a client clarity on their career direction. I have a good understanding of what elements need to be considered in a career decision\u2014from labour market information, to required training and skills needed. All in all, at the end of the conversation, it is the client who ultimately makes the decision about their career.<br\/><br\/><strong>What are some common career questions you hear?<\/strong><br\/><em>What kind of jobs will be stable? How can I pay for training? How can income assistance help me?<\/em> These are all things I can assist the client with. A lot of the time, they just need someone who\u2019s not in their inner circle to bounce ideas off of and get valuable feedback from. <br\/><br\/><strong>What has been an important moment in your own career journey?<\/strong><br\/>When my previous boss advised me to apply for the employment counsellor position, I didn\u2019t think I had enough skills or experience to move forward in my career, but she prodded me to apply anyway\u2014and here I am. I\u2019m thankful to her for believing in me.<\/p><p><strong>What's the best piece of advice you'd like to give?<\/strong><br\/>Life is short, and we don\u2019t know what the future will hold. This isn\u2019t a practice\u2014it\u2019s the real thing, so give it your best shot.<br\/> <br\/>Also, make memories along the way\u2014don\u2019t leave it all until the end. My parents had wanted to travel once they retired, but when my mom passed away at 54, it didn\u2019t turn out the way they had planned (though thankfully they did get in a couple of years to travel). It made me realize we are not guaranteed those years, or health, or wealth\u2014so make the most of each day.<br\/><br\/>Hazel\u2019s journey\u2014from program participant to employment counsellor\u2014has given her the insight to understand her clients\u2019 needs and support them in finding the right path. Clearly, even after 25 years, Hazel still loves her work!<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Hazel shares her path to becoming an employment counsellor.

This wiring made sense during prehistoric times where each negative memory could be the clue to survival; in today\u2019s world, constant negativity is no longer necessary and can actually get in our way. Being aware of this bias is the first key to dealing with job rejection and to regaining control of your job search.<br\/><br\/>Here are seven more tips for dealing with job rejection:<\/p><ol><li><strong>Recognize that feeling bad after job rejection is natural<\/strong> This is why a <em>NO<\/em> feels so horrible and negative thoughts can linger or nag at you. Make a conscious decision to re-frame your thoughts. Instead of thinking that you didn\u2019t get the job because you messed up at the interview; think about other scenarios like the possibility there was an internal candidate or maybe you were not the best fit for the team. Recognize that the reason is not necessarily just about you.<\/li><li><strong>Maintain an open mind <\/strong>Go into a job interview with an open mind. In the event that you do not get the job, whenever possible, request feedback from the interviewer in order to determine if there is an area that you can work on. Remember, just because you didn\u2019t get the job doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t qualified.<\/li><li><strong>Continue the momentum<\/strong> It\u2019s common for job seekers to \u2018wait to see what happens\u2019 after an interview before applying for other jobs. However, keeping the job search momentum going both maintains motivation and opens up other possibilities.<\/li><li><strong>Resist overanalyzing <\/strong>Don\u2019t reflect on what you felt you did wrong in the interview, focus instead on what you did right. It is okay to self-critique in order to do better the next time, but overanalyzing only serves to keep you stuck in disappointment.<\/li><li><strong>Have a positive attitude <\/strong>Your attitude is just as important as your skills when it comes to a job interview. Feelings of frustration, depletion and desperation, if not acknowledged, can carry over into the next job interview.<\/li><li><strong>Don\u2019t project into the future <\/strong>Worrying about things in the future that you do not have control of only makes you more afraid and insecure. Instead, focus on the present and be pro-active in your response to job rejection.<\/li><li><strong>Seek help<\/strong> Visit a <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13140638\" >WorkBC Centre in your area<\/a> to receive assistance with tailoring your resume, practicing your interview skills and improving your job search. Career Advisors are available to assist you with all aspects of your job search including how to deal with job rejection.<\/li><\/ol><p>Awareness and preparation are the keys to dealing with job rejection. Knowing what to expect, re-framing your thoughts, focusing on the positive and continuing to persevere in your job search until you find the best fit for you will ultimately get you to your goal of sustainable, long-term employment. There may be many NOs in your job search but it only takes one YES to secure employment.<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Didn't get the job? How to deal with job rejection."}

However, when she entered high school, she wasn\u2019t sure how to put her goal into action. It was difficult for her to visualize how her secondary education could contribute to a fulfilling career after graduation. So she reached out to her teachers and her older sister for advice.<br\/><br\/>Kendra\u2019s teachers set her up with a three-week electrical co-op experience, to give her a chance to try the trade out and see if it was the right fit. It was this positive work experience that helped her confirm where she wanted to go.<br\/><br\/>When she returned to school, Kendra wanted to continue her career development. It was her sister\u2014a recent carpentry graduate\u2014who recommended she try the district trade program to gain valuable training in her field. Kendra found that the program allowed just the right balance of work and school to keep her focused. \u201cBeing able to get out into the workforce, then come back and learn in a classroom, really helped strengthen my experience,\u201d she says.<br\/><br\/>In hindsight, Kendra sees how her time in high school prepared her for success in the trades, noting \u201cEverything I did was oriented toward becoming an electrician.\u201d Kendra\u2019s required secondary coursework and the trades-related shop classes she had taken in high school all contributed to her promising career.

Finding a new job shouldn\u2019t be.<br\/><br\/>Each country has different standards when it comes to resume creation, and Canada is no exception. Through following the steps on this blog post, you will be able to increase your resume quality and better apply yourself to Canadian employers.<br\/><br\/><strong>Step One: Ditch the photocopier<\/strong><br\/>Although it may be tempting to create one resume and hand it out to all potential employers, this is not effective. As no two companies are the same, each resume should be tailored to the specific job posting. Companies want to know that you have put in the effort to create an application based on their needs as opposed to the general needs of the industry.<br\/><br\/><strong>Step Two: Connect the dots<\/strong><br\/>On average, during the first round of reviewing resumes, employers will look over each application for<br\/>10 seconds. Therefore, it is important that you catch the reviewer\u2019s eye immediately. One of the most effective ways to do this is to include phrases and terms in your resume that are listed on the job posting. This is also beneficial as many companies are including A.I. in their hiring processes which only recommend individuals for interviews that have the stated key terms in their application. In brief, employers should not have to think about how your skills could fit the role; it should be clear.<br\/><br\/><strong>Step Three: Trim the fat<\/strong><br\/>Do not force a piece into a puzzle that does not fit. If you have information on your resume that is entirely irrelevant to the job posting and the company, remove it. Although it can be tempting to show all your experiences and awards to potential employers, this can lead to a cluttered resume \u2013 save this information for the interview!<br\/><br\/><strong>Step Four: Use the STAR method<\/strong><br\/>One of the most effective and widely used storytelling methods for experiences is the STAR method. STAR stands for situation, task, activity and result. When describing previous experiences, you must describe the situation (your role in the company), the task (a problem or job needed to be completed), the activity (actions taken to solve the problem and\/or complete the job), and the result (the outcomes).<br\/><br\/><strong>Step Five:<\/strong> Add personality<br\/>In recent years, many companies have begun hiring individuals for not only their skills, but their ability to fit into the workplace culture. It is important to express your unique personality through your resume because, when you do, hiring managers can ensure you\u2019re a match. There are several different ways that can be used to express your individuality. Depending on which industry you choose to enter, you can incorporate colour, icons, images, your hobbies, as well as a short personal profile that describes your goals and work specialization.<br\/><br\/><strong>Step 6: Maximize space<\/strong><br\/>For many positions, the ideal resume is between one to two pages. Anything longer may be daunting for the hiring manager. Although it can be difficult to show how you fit the position in just a couple pages, through choosing a resume format that maximizes space, it can be done with ease. There are many online resources that offer free resume templates, and these should be explored. In addition, to save space, remove the references from your resume, and state \u201cReferences available upon request.\u201d Lastly, refrain from shrinking the font size below an 11 point to fit your content, as this can be hard on the readers\u2019 eyes.<br\/><br\/>Learn more \u2013 visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13697497\" >Job Application Tips<\/a> page!<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Creating resumes for Canadian employers."}

But when she first tried welding in shop class, she quickly discovered her new career path. \u201cI never thought welding would be something I like\u2014it was a big eye-opener,\u201d she explains.<br\/><br\/>She wants to show other girls that there are careers in what she likes to call the hands-on, \u201cmessy\u201d trades. Although she found welding difficult at first, she refused to give up and continued to expand her skills\u2014even venturing into the realm of metal art! Sarah excitedly describes a few of her creative projects, including various garden ornaments and even a copper corsage she crafted for her grad ceremony in 2019.<br\/><br\/>No longer a novice, she stresses the importance of patience and persistence. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to be the best on your first try. You have to ask for help, get pointers, try different things\u2014and take lots of notes,\u201d she laughs.<br\/><br\/>Yet, while Sarah was making major career decisions, she received some life-altering news. She describes the experience of being diagnosed with high-functioning autism while still in high school, and she admits she was initially worried it would impact her future. However, the additional support she received through her school helped her develop the confidence to tackle bigger projects head on. Sarah now views her diagnosis as an empowering moment in her life. \u201cA lot of people think that mental health is a setback, but I like to think of it as [just another] challenge that helps you grow.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Because she was able to gain credits toward her welding certificate while still a student, Sarah was able to start her career before graduating secondary school. She completed her Red Seal exam in early 2020 and is currently logging enough work hours to become an official Red Seal Welder\u2014which will allow her to work across Canada.

When she was in school, her teacher told her that the best welder he had ever met was a woman\u2014which encouraged her to keep going.

In fact, just a few short weeks later, she found herself part of the team working on the development of various vaccines for COVID-19. <\/p><p>A big part of Lilin\u2019s job is to connect with partners that use the company\u2019s specially-designed delivery technology. The technology produced by Acuitas is an important part of the vaccine process that makes sure that the treatment gets into our cells. <br\/><br\/>In addition to her work supporting the business side of the company, Lilin helps to put initial legal agreements in place with new partners. She also takes charge of, and provides support for, projects in marketing, finance and human resources. She is always quick to jump in where needed and finds that she learns a great deal by doing this.<br\/><br\/>Lilin moved from China to Canada when she was six years old. Growing up in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside, she found that playing sports was a great way to make friends in the community. Lilin noticed the positive effect of sports on her physical and mental health, which inspired her dream of working in an area that had some connection to health care. In secondary school, she joined a business club, which opened the door to wanting to learn more about the corporate world. That\u2019s when she knew that she wanted to put her two interests together into a career. Lilin\u2019s dream to have a career that included both health and business shaped her decision to complete a Bachelor of Kinesiology and a Master of Management degree at the University of British Columbia.<br\/><br\/>Outside of school, Lilin took on a range of jobs and volunteer roles that would help her gain skills. \u201cI wanted to make sure that I had some experience in the two sectors in addition to my education so that when I graduated, I could find a job that would be both challenging and rewarding.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Lilin credits much of her career success to the big sacrifices her parents made for her. She says, \u201cMy parents gave up their deeply-rooted life in China to make our home in Canada, and they did so with very little resources. They wanted to give me the opportunity for a better life. I have seen them work hard their entire lives to be able to take care of our family. The drive for all of my efforts is to make them proud and to give back to them for everything they have done and continue to do for me. They are my inspiration.\u201d<br\/><br\/>While currently working from home because of the pandemic, Lilin says that she still gets to connect with her co-workers. They have biweekly check-in video calls with the entire team and access to an internal company communications channel where staff can chat and share photos, videos and news \u2014 similar to how it would be if they were all in the office in person. Lilin says that it has helped the team to stay in touch.<br\/><br\/>For those looking to jumpstart their career, Lilin\u2019s advice is to be open and flexible stating, \u201cIf you are prepared to take on different tasks that support the needs of your organization, you never know what might come from it. You could spark an interest in an area that you didn\u2019t know you had.\u201d She adds, \u201cBe open to opportunities that come your way and always put forth your best effort \u2014 you never know where that might take you!\u201d<br\/><br\/>Are you looking to build a career you can be passionate about?

We watched the news, unsure of what it was, and before we knew it, it reached Canada \u2013 in our own communities. Things changed fast. From working one day, to being laid off the next, some services and businesses closed their doors temporarily. If that wasn\u2019t enough, we were then advised to stay home so that we could help control the spread of this unknown virus. For many, this meant not being able to interact with extended family, close friends or colleagues. The new realities of 2020: social isolation and physical distancing. These two things can have a huge impact on one\u2019s mental health.<br\/><br\/>Physical distancing took on a life of its own. What I found affected me is that no one says hello anymore \u2013 even when at a safe distance. It could be the wearing of masks, hiding the mouth and\/or smile, but even eyes or a wave can say hello too. Canadians are known for being pleasant, kind and nice \u2013 for not only saying sorry, but also hello. This tells me that people are really scared. <br\/><br\/>We all have our own experience \u2013 our own story. I was fortunate to be able to continue working from home, for which I am thankful. I know that my story would be different if this wasn\u2019t the case. One area that I personally had to work on and be aware of was my COVID-19 information intake. At times it felt like it was \u201ceverything COVID-19\u201d and I could feel my mood and my mind get very distant and overwhelmed.

The adjustments and uncertainty of it all is what can create unrest.<br\/><br\/>One thing we do have control over is how we choose to handle it. Easier said than done, I know! But awareness of where you are at is the first step and probably the most important. You need to recognize how and what you are feeling and know that it is okay.

She was looking for a steady job where she could continue to learn, grow and be challenged in a positive way. After some research into different careers, she decided nursing would be the best fit. <\/p><p>It wasn\u2019t an easy change to make. Lisa had to first upgrade a few high school courses and she continued to work to support herself while attending nursing school. As she looks back at her journey now, she realizes that she has achieved so much more than just a \u201csteady job.\u201d She has found a career where she makes a difference in peoples\u2019 lives. Despite the work being difficult some days, Lisa describes it as incredibly fulfilling. <br\/><br\/>As a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) at a hospital in the Fraser Valley, Lisa\u2019s role has her moving throughout the facility \u2014 from attending the Emergency Room to accompanying a patient being transferred by ambulance to a specialist appointment. <br\/><br\/>\u201cA typical day doesn\u2019t exist at my job,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI work shift work \u2014 usually 12 hours. When I walk through the door, I have to be ready for anything \u2014 and I am.\u201d Lisa adds that the variety is the best part, \u201cOne of the things I love about my job is that each day is so different.\u201d<br\/><br\/>As for working during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lisa explains that while much has changed \u2014 especially for health care workers directly treating COVID-19 patients \u2014 in other ways, some things have stayed the same. For hospital workers, regular handwashing, wearing masks, using hand sanitizers and deep cleaning high-traffic areas happens every day. They are aware of how infectious diseases can spread and they do everything they can to minimize that risk. <br\/><br\/>She points out it\u2019s hard for patients in the hospital who can\u2019t have family members, stating, \u201cThat might be one of the more difficult things It is heartbreaking to see people who are sick and unable to find comfort in a hug from a family member.\u201d <br\/><br\/>As a nurse, Lisa is often with people, patients and families on some of the most difficult days of their lives. \u201cThere are multiple layers to the work that I do. What some people don\u2019t realize is that there is also an emotional piece to my job. I treat people who are in pain and who may be really scared. It is important that as a nurse, no matter what I am feeling, they see me as calm and capable and that they feel confident that I am there to help them. That is a big part of the work that I do,\u201d she says.<br\/><br\/>Lisa is committed to reaching out to help new nurses. She remembers the people who went out of their way for her and how much that support meant. She explains, \u201cI am grateful for the people who took the time for me. My goal is to do the same for others. In fact, I see it as my responsibility. One small act of kindness, support or show of compassion can make a huge difference in someone\u2019s life. That\u2019s important to remember.\u201d <br\/><br\/>In her spare time, Lisa has found great ways to relax and re-energize. Lisa, her partner and their rescue dog regularly hike, camp and spend time in nature. The physical demands of the hike let her burn off some of the stress from work. She also kayaks, runs and loves to cook.

Marilou explains that while her job requires a great deal of skill, knowledge, patience and know-how, she is often reminded why she continues to work \u2014 at an age when others might consider winding down their career or even looking at retirement. For Marilou, the decision is quite simple: \u201cI love helping people find the right house or apartment\u2026 at whatever stage of life they are in. There is such magic in helping someone find a place to call home. There is nothing like it.\u201d<br\/><br\/>Marilou \u2014 who now works in partnership with her son and his husband \u2014 still gets a thrill when her phone rings with a new client or when someone puts in an offer on one of her listings. She is confident that her wealth of experience still offers a great deal to her clients stating, \u201cWe are seeing more and more people working later in life \u2014 and I know for me, I choose to put a spotlight on the length of my experience. It is an asset. I think those of us who are a bit older have a great deal to contribute. We need to be confident about our age \u2014 not shy away from it.\u201d<br\/><br\/>On any given day, Marilou is on the go. She explains, \u201cOur days are busy! We might be handing over keys to a young couple who are expecting. Then it\u2019s off to a showing across town. Then it\u2019s back to another neighbourhood to pick up keys that will be handed over to a different excited buyer later that day. There are always texts, calls and emails that need a quick response. Nothing stands still in real estate.\u201d And that means neither does Marilou. <br\/><br\/>That said, working during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how Marilou and her team do their jobs. For instance, instead of regular open houses, there are now online virtual showings. She also says that for in-person showings \u2014 which now only happen with people who are very serious about buying the property \u2014 masks are a must, and there is a great deal of cleaning that goes on between appointments. Likewise, weekly in-person company meetings have become Zoom video calls, which Marilou confesses she prefers because they are more efficient. <br\/><br\/>It\u2019s not just work that is busy. Marilou has an active social life and loves to spend time with friends and family. She participates in The Ride to Conquer Cancer and has found a love for cycling. In addition, Marilou takes her rescue dog on walks and hikes \u2014 giving them both fresh air and exercise. \u201cI find that the more I stay active, the more energy I have,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when I find something that works, I stick with it!\u201d<br\/><br\/>Making a difference in peoples\u2019 lives is what drives Marilou. She says, \u201cIf you want to be in this business, do it because you genuinely want to help people. For me, there is nothing more rewarding.\u201d Along with her job, Marilou finds purpose as a volunteer facilitator with a mental health program through Vancouver Family Connections, a local non-profit. She also believes that it\u2019s important to balance out all of the activity by slowing down a bit and sitting back to enjoy life. Marilou reveals her secret formula to a happy life, \u201cFor goodness sake, don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone \u2014 especially on social media! You see people on there who seem to have perfect lives, but that\u2019s all an illusion. Be who you truly are and don\u2019t compare yourself to anyone.

While some services have been open throughout the pandemic, others closed temporarily. And then there were a few who closed only their physical retail spaces but continued to do business in other ways.<br\/><br\/><strong>Closed doors, but still open<\/strong><br\/> <br\/>James Watson, owner of Curious Comics, closed his stores in Victoria, Langford and Nanaimo on March 25. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my staff to have to work and maybe get sick,\u201d he says. But James\u2019s challenge was clear: he had to keep money coming in and keep his loyal customers happy.<br\/> <br\/>Retailers with established web stores prior to the pandemic could point customers there. But this wasn\u2019t a feasible option for a small retailer like Curious Comics. He explains, \u201cI had to update our website and post almost daily to Facebook and Instagram about the services we offered.\u201d Because Curious Comics didn\u2019t have their product online, James took photos at all three locations to show customers what items he had available. He took payments by phone and online through PayPal, e-transfer and credit card, then delivered or mailed each purchase out.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Kinks in the supply chain<\/strong><br\/> <br\/>Retailers like James rely on a steady stream of new product. His most loyal customers come in week after week seeking out the latest releases. And he wanted, as much as possible, to continue to provide them with this service, especially at a time when small comforts were important.<br\/> <br\/>Unfortunately, the pandemic disrupted the distribution of all kinds of goods, and James\u2019s weekly deliveries of new comics were no exception. Luckily, the shop\u2019s other products suddenly gained new popularity. \u201cOur store[s] had many items people seemed to want during the lockdown, such as puzzles, games and graphic novels,\u201d he says. His regular customers also supported the shop by buying gift certificates to use once regular inventory was back.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Opening the doors with care<\/strong><br\/> <br\/>For all retailers, COVID-19 has meant that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d just isn\u2019t an option anymore. Sales have been impacted as people spend more time at home. And shops have needed to strike a balance between welcoming customers in person and keeping everyone safe and comfortable.<br\/> <br\/>Like retailers across the province, James had a lot of work to do before reopening this summer. He installed barriers at the counters, stocked up on cleaning supplies and sanitizer, encouraged mask wearing and set limits on the number of people in the stores. Many retailers modified their actual spaces to safely accommodate customers. Adjustments such as adding directional arrows, reconfiguring aisles and extending outdoor patios have become commonplace.<br\/> <br\/>Businesses had to react quickly in order to comply with government health and safety requirements. \u201cAlong with limiting the store\u2019s capacity, our first step was acquiring Plexiglass\u2122 shields for the [registers],\u201d explains David Alvarez, Cook St. Liquor general manager. \u201cPutting up the WorkSafeBC posters on the entrance of the business was also required. In the early stages, we remained open with regular hours of operation while we rigorously wiped and cleaned handles, registers and high-traffic surfaces.\u201d<br\/> <br\/><strong>Take-out, delivery and online: the new normal<\/strong><br\/> <br\/>For Cook St. Liquor, regular communication via its customer mailing list has been crucial in conveying the changes and options available. \u201cWe sent newsletters\u2026promoting free local delivery\u2014with drivers who were following distancing protocol and health standards\u2014and eventually we launched our online store to compensate for those who were self-isolating,\u201d David says.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Discovering the upside<\/strong><br\/> <br\/>Although the numerous changes made by retail stores had to be done to comply with health and safety measures, many businesses have noticed several benefits as a result. While certain industries have seen an uptick in revenues, others have been given the push they needed to venture into online sales.<br\/> <br\/>\u201cUltimately, sales have gained momentum since the start of the pandemic,\u201d says David. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that the diversification of service, with expanding delivery, taking our inventory online and maintaining regular hours of operation\u2026has been a big part of that. I believe we would have invested in an online store [eventually], but the timing couldn\u2019t have been better.\u201d<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"For many businesses, their doors may be closed to the public, but they're still available to serve customers - through creative alternatives."}

For many, this has meant making the change from commuting to work each day to working from home.<br\/> <br\/>The routine of going into work provides structure; it feels \u201cnormal\u201d to leave where you live and go somewhere else to do your job. At first, working from home can feel a little strange. However, there are a few things you can do to help make it easier.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Set a routine<\/strong><br\/>Create a routine for yourself \u2014 even if you live in a studio apartment and your commute is two feet from your bed to your table. Set an alarm and get up at the same time each day. Shower and get dressed. Get a coffee or a glass of water and sit down at your workspace on time, like you would if you were in the office. A routine helps your brain prepare for the workday by getting you into the \u201cat-work\u201d mindset \u2014 even if you\u2019re not there physically.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Make a to-do list<\/strong><br\/>Make a weekly and\/or daily to-do list to help you keep track of all your tasks \u2014 especially if you are having a hard time switching into \u201cwork\u201d mode. Just remember to be kind to yourself if you don\u2019t finish everything on your list \u2014 everyone dealing with additional stress due to the pandemic \u2014 and remind yourself that you\u2019re doing your best. The <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pomodoro_Technique#:~:text=The%20Pomodoro%20Technique%20is%20a,length%2C%20separated%20by%20short%20breaks.\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pomodoro Technique<\/a> is a useful method that can help you tackle your to-do list in actionable sections (you work for 25 minutes at a time with 5-minute breaks in between).<br\/> <br\/><strong>Set up your workspace<\/strong><br\/>If you can, set up an area in your home just for work. Perhaps you are lucky enough to have a separate room that you can work in (This is especially important if you have kids at home!). If you live in a small space, find a spot to think of as your workplace and set it up as best you can. Use a drawer or a box to store all of your work items at the end of the day; this will help to keep your work and home space tidy.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Set your work hours<\/strong><br\/>It\u2019s easy for work hours and personal hours to blend when you work from home. While there might be times when you need to work outside of regular office hours, try not to do it too often. When the workday is over, it may be helpful to do something to signify you are done for the day. Put your laptop and other work items away, go for a walk or even wash your coffee mug. Small actions like these can help you feel like the workday is over, so you can move on to your personal time.<br\/> <br\/><strong>Set some rules for your family or roommate<\/strong><br\/>If you have a partner, children or a roommate, it\u2019s helpful to negotiate what will work best for each of you with this new way of doing things. You might ask your children not to come into your office when the door is shut, indicating that you are on a video or conference call. If you have a partner or a roommate who is also working from home, create a schedule of when to take breaks, eat lunch and make important video calls. Working out some rules that make sense for everyone in advance will help.<br\/> <br\/>It\u2019s also important to remember that if your child comes into the room while you are on a video call, it\u2019s not the end of the world. This can happen to anyone \u2014 today might be your turn. After all, everyone knows that sometimes your five-year-old can\u2019t wait to tell you about the bird they saw!<br\/> <br\/><strong>Connect with co-workers<\/strong><br\/>Make a point to connect with your co-workers outside of formal meetings. Set up a time and take a coffee break with one of them over a video call and chat like you would if you were to meet in the breakroom at your office. It\u2019s important to stay connected with people \u2014 and not just about work. It\u2019ll help brighten your co-worker\u2019s day too!<br\/> <br\/><strong>Give yourself a break<\/strong><br\/>Accepting that things may not be as easy while you work from home can reduce a lot of stress. It is an adjustment \u2014 especially during a global pandemic. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that your emotions during this time are valid and that it\u2019s okay to feel what you are feeling. Accept that some days will likely be more productive than others \u2014 for you and for your co-workers.<br\/> <br\/>Last but not least, listen to the advice of B.C.

{"title":"Hands-on Work","id":14865053,"template":"Blog Post, News Post, Success Stories Post","folder":"Blog","status":"Content Revisions","Page Title":"Hands-on Work","Date":"22 January 2021","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p>When COVID-19 spread, we had to adapt our workspaces and daily practices almost overnight. Through technology and creativity \u2014 and a lot of patience \u2014 we\u2019ve figured out a way to move forward and continue to be productive. <br\/><br\/>But what about the many essential businesses and professions that require close contact? How do those who perform hands-on work \u2014 from registered massage therapists to hairstylists\u2014navigate the challenges of applying the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bccdc.ca\/health-info\/diseases-conditions\/covid-19\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">new health guidelines<\/a> while serving clients up close and personal? <br\/><br\/><strong>As in all relationships, communication is key<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Karen McLellan is a registered acupuncturist with her own clinic in Victoria. After closing her doors for nine weeks at the beginning of the pandemic, she found she needed to completely rethink the way she did things \u2014 to meet her regulatory authority\u2019s new guidelines, and for the health and comfort of her clients and herself.<br\/><br\/>It started with opening the lines of communication. \u201cI contacted [my clients] to let them know of the new procedures and safety protocols I would be implementing,\u201d she says.<br\/><br\/>Business owners and hands-on practitioners, like Karen, need to ensure that customers feel safe when seeking treatment or services. That means not only following guidance provided by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.gov.bc.ca\/gov\/content\/health\/about-bc-s-health-care-system\/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Provincial Health Officer (PHO)<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worksafebc.com\/en\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WorkSafeBC<\/a> and other organizations such as a regulatory authority, but clearly communicating it to clients up front. <br\/><br\/>Still, Karen notes the risks, \u201cThey needed to understand that although I would be taking all necessary precautions\u2026there\u2019s still an added risk of exposure due to how close we would be during treatment.\u201d Karen told her patients that they would ultimately have to decide for themselves whether the benefits would outweigh the risks \u2014 even if it means temporarily losing clients. <br\/><br\/><strong>Doubling down on cleanliness<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Workers like Karen who work hands-on with the public are uniquely qualified to meet the challenges the pandemic presents. As acupuncturists are part of a governing regulatory authority, they are used to meeting a high-safety standard in their practices. After all, preventing the spread of disease and infection has always been of primary concern for individuals in jobs that require close contact with their clients. With COVID-19, however, the focus on cleanliness can\u2019t be stressed enough. <br\/><br\/><strong>Upping the creativity<\/strong><br\/><br\/>For regulated practitioners, like Karen, who wish to continue performing acupuncture, they must now do so while wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Whenever Karen is with a patient, she wears a mask under a face shield, along with a freshly laundered apron. She also has reduced her patient load to allow extra time between treatments to swap out PPE, clean surfaces and keep clients from encountering one another in her small workspace. <br\/><br\/>However, it\u2019s not always clear-cut. For instance, you can\u2019t tattoo a client behind a plexiglass barrier or give a haircut via Zoom. So, in addition to keeping regular cleaning standards, other types of hands-on workers must find new creative ways of doing their jobs. (The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worksafebc.com\/en\/about-us\/covid-19-updates\/health-and-safety\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Health and Safety<\/a> page on WorkSafe BC is a great place to start.)<br\/><br\/><strong>Doing the best for the long term<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Karen\u2019s efforts won\u2019t be short term. Like many hands-on practitioners, she\u2019s planning to translate her new procedures and layers of protection into best practices going forward. She\u2019s installed a new HVAC filtration system that will clean the air for years to come, and she\u2019ll continue with the extra cleaning protocols. She\u2019s also adding a standard safety note to each appointment reminder, asking patients to reschedule if they\u2019re experiencing certain symptoms of illness. <br\/><br\/>After all, what will help stop the spread of the pandemic will also help curb the transmission of common colds and the flu. And that can only be good for business, now and in the long term.<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"How essential businesses performing hands-on work can still serve clients while applying new health guidelines."}
{"title":"How to Prepare for a Virtual Career Fair as an Employer","id":14865048,"template":"Blog Post, News Post, Success Stories Post","folder":"Blog","status":"Content Revisions","Page Title":"How to Prepare for a Virtual Career Fair as an Employer","Date":"5 February 2021","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p>There are many benefits for attending hiring and career fairs as an employer \u2014 promote your organization, recruit talented candidates, and keep your networking skills sharp. Because most events are online this year, it\u2019s more convenient than ever to make the time to find the right employees for your business. We\u2019ve compiled six tips to help you navigate a virtual hiring or career fair like a seasoned pro.<br\/><br\/><strong>1. Complete your bio<\/strong><br\/>Most platforms will have a section for the booth host to complete a brief biography on their company or organization. To create an engaging virtual booth, fill out the bio and add resources or link to your website. Likewise, adding a picture personalizes the interaction \u2014 if the event isn\u2019t using a video messaging system, you want attendees to feel like they are talking to a real person.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Test the platform<\/strong><br\/>Not every hiring fair will use the same software \u2014 so it\u2019s best to familiarize yourself with it before the big day. If you can, attend the training sessions offered beforehand. (Connect with the program organizer if you\u2019re unsure about when these are offered or watch the <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/PCSkt-uKXHw\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">virtual interview video<\/a>  for employers to gain insight into the process.) <br\/><br\/><strong>3. Recruit backup<\/strong><br\/>Even mini events (less than 100 attendees) can get busy. Virtual events usually create a queue of attendees waiting to speak to the booth host. Each person is given approximately 10 minutes (although this may differ by event), which can add up quickly if you\u2019re the only person running it. If you\u2019re able to, ask a member of your team to be on standby for when the queue gets too long or for when you need a quick break. <br\/><br\/><strong>4. Be upfront if you\u2019re hiring<\/strong><br\/>Let candidates know if you\u2019re hiring or simply recruiting for potential future opportunities. Some people will be actively looking for a job at the event, so it\u2019s best to let them know (either in the bio or at the beginning of the session) if you are screening candidates that day. Again, you want to make sure that you are talking to the right individuals \u2014 so being upfront will save everyone time.<br\/><br\/><strong>5. Create a go-to introduction<\/strong><br\/>Create a template for seamlessly introducing yourself, your company and why your organization is at the event. Either create a 30-second elevator pitch (if it\u2019s a video call) or a two-sentence blurb that you can copy n\u2019 paste into the chat box. This will help break the ice and gets the conversation going \u2014 you may have less than 10 minutes to talk, so make the most of it.<br\/><br\/><strong>6. Be open<\/strong><br\/>For many career fair organizers, this is the first time they\u2019ve offered an online hiring event \u2014 not everything will go as planned. Be ready for hiccups, connectivity issues and the possibility that you won\u2019t talk to as many attendees as you would have liked. Similarly, for most people, this will be their first virtual hiring event \u2014 be patient, kind and willing to go with the flow.<br\/><br\/>Although COVID-19 has impacted our ability to connect at an in-person event, employers can still reap the same benefits from a virtual one \u2013 and from the comforts of your home office!

Check out six tips to help you take your career search to the next level. <br\/><br\/><strong>1. Check your tech<\/strong><br\/>Avoid scrambling to download the software or configure your audio on the day. Ask yourself the following questions:<br\/>a. <em>Will I be typing? <\/em>Then make sure you\u2019re at a comfortable desk.<br\/>b. <em>Is there an audio\/visual element? <\/em>Then dress appropriately for an interview \u2014 see our resources for planning ahead <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13697497\" >here<\/a>.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Research who will be attending<\/strong><br\/>Learn about the different employers or job resources that will be there. Make a list of the top five must-attend booths. (You may not have time to visit every booth, so a clear game plan will help you feel less overwhelmed.) On a similar note, write down a few key questions for the employers \u2014 you\u2019re interviewing them too!<br\/><br\/><strong>Note:<\/strong> Not all booths will be conducting screening interviews at the event. Some are there to encourage job seekers to apply to future jobs with their companies; while others, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/\" >WorkBC.ca<\/a>, are job resource services that are available to help you in your future career pursuits! <br\/><br\/><strong>3. Prepare your pitch<\/strong><br\/>Perfect the two-minute elevator pitch about yourself. Since you may have less than 10 minutes to talk to a representative, make a one to three sentence pitch about yourself. Describe your experience or education, career goals, and why you are attending this event. <br\/><br\/><strong>4. Go with the flow<\/strong><br\/>As we all learn to navigate the sudden transition to virtual-only events, hiccups are bound to happen. If your computer crashes, the system boots you out, or the Wi-Fi fails, it\u2019ll be okay. But with that said, don\u2019t rely entirely on technology \u2014 keep a notebook or document open and write down important information or resources. The virtual platform may not save that information or may malfunction mid-interview, so it\u2019s good to keep a hard copy in case that happens.<br\/><br\/><strong>5. Save the venting for a phone call with a close friend<\/strong><br\/>A career fair is like a speed interview, so you don\u2019t want to air your frustrations with a potential future boss about your challenging current job search or a difficult previous employer. (Mentioning that the job search has been difficult due to COVID-19 is one thing, spending your precious 10-minute pre-interview venting won\u2019t get you very far.)<br\/><br\/><strong>6. Complete a self reflection after the event<\/strong><br\/>Take five minutes after the event to reflect on the experience. <em>What worked? What didn\u2019t work? Did you learn something new that will help you in your job search? What would you want to do differently?<\/em> Taking the time to reflect will help you improve your performance for next time. Some events will be better suited to your goals than others, so plan to attend a few \u2014 these experiences will help you improve your virtual interviewing skills.<br\/> <br\/>Help spread the word and reduce virtual career fair anxiety \u2014 share these tips on social media so everyone can be better prepared.

Although arguably not as convenient as text messages, email plays a key role in standard business communications. That\u2019s why you need to know how to write emails well. In this two-part series, we will cover a list of best practices to improve your email game. In the first part, we tackle the basic guidelines for professional co-worker and client written communication.<br\/><br\/><strong>Is it email worthy?<\/strong><br\/><br\/>With so many of us now working remotely, the casual conversation over the water-cooler has become increasingly rare. So, too, is stopping in at a co-worker\u2019s cubicle for a quick chat. And while a phone call is often a good choice, a written note allows you to craft your message more carefully and gives both parties a paper record of what was said. It also lets the recipient deal with the information at a time that suits them best. <br\/><br\/><strong>Or should I text?<\/strong><br\/><br\/>In some situations, and in certain workplaces, texting can be appropriate\u2014you need to let your boss know you\u2019re having connectivity issues or you\u2019re running late due to a cancelled bus. Either way, more supervisors now use cell phones to stay connected with their employees. <br\/><br\/>If your message is less than 100 characters and the situation is appropriate, consider sending a text; otherwise, your default should be to send an email. What email lacks in immediacy, it makes up for in its ability to convey a larger amount of information in a more businesslike way. <br\/><br\/><strong>Be professional<\/strong><br\/><br\/>When you\u2019re communicating through email, you\u2019re presenting yourself through words. Make sure that the image you\u2019re sending is a good one. Check your spelling and grammar and use full sentences. While most business emails don\u2019t need to be formal, they should still be correct. On a similar note, if you\u2019re sending an email on a particularly difficult or personal topic, draft the email and then save it for later. Take some time away to allow yourself to be more objective about it\u2014you can even ask a trusted co-worker to read it over before you to hit send to ensure that the tone and wording is appropriate. (You don\u2019t want to send something that you might regret later after you\u2019ve had time to think about it.)<br\/><br\/><strong>Remember to sound human<\/strong><br\/><br\/>The tone you strike will depend on your relationship with the recipient and, of course, on the subject matter. You\u2019ll likely speak differently to a teammate from the company softball league than to a senior vice-president you\u2019ve only met once on a conference call. <br\/><br\/>If you don\u2019t know the recipient colleague well, add in some pleasantries. This may be as simple as, \u201cI hope you\u2019re enjoying this lovely weather\u201d or more specific and personal like, \u201cHow are you adjusting to life with a labradoodle?\u201d In any case, a few words of warmth can go a long way to building a solid connection.<br\/><br\/><strong>Nail the subject line<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Remember that you\u2019re emailing for a specific purpose; let the recipient know what that is even before they open the message. Is action necessary on their part? Are you emailing just to keep them up to date? Whatever the reason, state it in the subject line\u2014whether that\u2019s, \u201cYour approval needed by Friday,\u201d \u201cRescheduling our Zoom to 9:30 am,\u201d or \u201cFYI: Marketing meeting minutes.\u201d <br\/><br\/><strong>Keep it short and sweet<\/strong><br\/><br\/>A work email isn\u2019t the place to let your thoughts wander. Shorter is usually better. Make the most of your reader\u2019s attention by getting right to the point. Try using a bulleted list where appropriate or make key information bold to for easier scanning.<br\/><br\/>If you\u2019re sending an attachment\u2014especially to someone outside of your organization\u2014be sure to mention it. This lets the recipient know that it\u2019s from you and gives them the go-ahead to open it safely.<br\/><br\/>Read more additional tips and tricks in <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14865044\" >Improve Your Email Game: Part Two<\/a>.<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Learning how to improve your email game is an important asset to your career.

In the second part, we\u2019ll go through additional etiquette and tips to help you improve your communication game\u2014whether it\u2019s your first office job or you\u2019re a seasoned pro looking to advance your applicable job skills.<br\/><br\/><strong>To emoji or not to emoji<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Common rule of thumb is to avoid using emojis in professional business emails. However, if you\u2019re on a more friendly basis with your co-worker or supervisor and the workplace culture allows it, an appropriately placed smiley face is usually acceptable in more casual communication.<br\/><br\/><strong>Always cc with care<\/strong><br\/><br\/>We\u2019re all busy, and streams of incoming email can be daunting. Think twice before cc\u2019ing someone who really doesn\u2019t need the information. By not overwhelming people with email, they\u2019ll pay more attention to the messages you do send. On a similar note, consider whether you need to \u201creply all\u201d to a message or if the original sender is the only person that needs a response. (Avoid being the person that unnecessarily hits \u201creply all\u201d to a mass communication email.)<br\/><br\/><strong>Check the recipient(s)<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Write the email before filling out the recipient block\u2014this will help you avoid accidently sending an incomplete email to your supervisor or a potential client. Complete a final check of the email addresses of all recipients before hitting send to avoid accidently sending a confidential correspondence to the wrong person. (Large organizations may have multiple people with similar names, and their emails may appear similar\u2014so always double check!)<br\/><br\/><strong>Avoid using unconventional fonts and colours<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Although it may be fun to embellish your emails with fancy fonts and fun colours, it may come across as unprofessional. If you need to draw attention to an important point in your email, use the highlighter function or bold the text. Likewise, the recipient of your email may have a visual barrier that makes it difficult to read certain fonts or coloured texts. To aid those who are visually impaired, use easy-to-read sans serif fonts\u2014such as Arial or Calibri\u2014and use standard black text.<br\/><br\/><strong>Open and close with style<\/strong><br\/><br\/>When choosing your opening and closing words, professional but friendly usually does the trick. While you might start a formal message with Dear _____, you can usually use Hello, Hi or another more casual greeting instead. <br\/><br\/>Closings can be tricky, and what works for one person (and one message) may not work for all. All the best, Sincerely, Thank you, Thanks, Regards, and even Cheers are all perfectly acceptable. Pick a closing that is professional, but still suits you. <br\/><br\/><strong>And finally, perfect your signature<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Use a standard signature block to make your emails a little more official. The title displayed in your signature block can validate the message, advice or decision conveyed in your email. Also, if you\u2019re not as familiar with the recipient, a signature gives them the information they need to put your message in context, and it makes it easy for them to reach you in the future.<br\/><br\/>Include your full name, title and company, as well as your phone number(s). Although the recipient will already have your email address from having received your message, it doesn\u2019t hurt to repeat it here. Additional notes or details on a signature block may vary depending on your organization, so review the standard practice at your office and modify your signature based on those expectations.<br\/><br\/>If you haven\u2019t already checked it out, you can read Improve Your Email Game: Part One <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14865046\" >here<\/a>. <\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Navigating the world of business emails can be tricky - check out our tips and tricks to learn how to improve your professional email game."}
{"title":"Why Co-op? Here Are Seven Reasons","id":14865041,"template":"Blog Post, News Post, Success Stories Post","folder":"Blog","status":"Content Revisions","Page Title":"Why Co-op? Here Are Seven Reasons","Date":"5 March 2021","Banner Image":[],"Page Content":"<p><strong><em>Did you know<\/em> <\/strong>that you can get paid while earning credits towards your school credential through<br\/>Co-operative Education (frequently called \u201cco-op\u201d) and Work Integrated Learning? It\u2019s an effective way to gain exposure AND experience towards your chosen program of study, and also helps you become more employable upon graduation.<br\/><br\/>Co-op Education and Work Integrated Learning consists of alternating academic and paid work terms. The work term provides experience in a workplace setting related to the field of study. Work terms generally start in January, May or September and last for approximately four to eight months. <br\/><br\/><strong><em>FACT:<\/em><\/strong> There are over 500 hundred <a href=\"https:\/\/co-op.bc.ca\/search-co-op-programs\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post-secondary programs<\/a> in B.C. offering a co-op component.<br\/><br\/>Here are <strong><em>seven reasons to co-op:<\/em><\/strong><br\/><br\/><strong>1. Take the opportunity to try out your career first before graduation <\/strong><br\/><br\/>By participating in a co-op placement, you\u2019ll get a better understanding if this particular career is for you. You may find aspects that you like or dislike and\/or other areas that you may want to explore further. It\u2019s a peek into your future. You\u2019ll have the opportunity to either continue on your original path or change it up by looking at other available options.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Apply your classroom learning to real-life situations <\/strong><br\/><br\/>By applying your classroom learning in the workplace, you\u2019ll soon realize how it benefits you in your professional life. For instance, if you are studying communications, you\u2019ll have the opportunity during your co-op to put your writing skills to work <strong>and <\/strong>to the test! <br\/><br\/><strong>3. Develop practical workplace skills<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Work with your supervisor to ensure you have opportunity to strengthen the skills you have and\/or want to improve upon, as well as develop new ones. There may be skills you were not aware of that are valuable to your professional and personal development. It will also give you more confidence when applying and interviewing for jobs.<br\/><br\/><strong>4. Gain career-related work experience <\/strong><br\/><br\/>Employers value prior work experience in the applicable field of study\/industry over solely having academic credentials. You become a much more rounded applicant once you have experience in your respective field. A co-op placement allows you to gain relevant work experience, which can increase your chances to a better outcome of future employment.<br\/><br\/><strong>5. Create a network of supports<\/strong><br\/><br\/>It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know \u2026 Is there truth to that? It\u2019s both! A co-op placement gives you the opportunity to establish and build connections in the workplace that are valuable for networking opportunities, as well as for receiving referrals and references for future employment. A co-op placement can ensure you position yourself in an employable situation after graduation. <br\/><br\/><strong>6. Develop your professional behaviour <\/strong><br\/><br\/>Professional behaviour, such as honesty, respect, integrity and a positive workplace attitude is important in any business or workplace setting and is helpful in your transition from school to the workforce. Co-op terms can teach you how to conduct yourself on the job, giving your best at all times, while creating your own high standards of work habits.<br\/><br\/><strong>7. Get paid while you work. <\/strong><br\/><br\/>A co-op work term can help with your education and living costs. <br\/><br\/>As an added bonus, there may also be grants available to co-op students. For instance, securing a co-op with the Province of B.C., you could be eligible for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.gov.bc.ca\/gov\/content\/careers-myhr\/all-employees\/career-development\/pacific-leaders\/co-op-grant\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pacific Leaders Tuition Grants for Co-op Employees<\/a>, which reimburses your co-op tuition fees (up to a max. of $1,000.00). <br\/><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/12593055\" >Check out<\/a> what previous co-op students are saying about their co-operative education experience. <br\/>For more information and next steps, visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14611762\" >www.workbc.ca\/co-op<\/a><\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Did you know that you can get paid while earning credits for school through co-op?

In my first term, our entire division was undergoing a massive move and some unexpected staffing changes; meanwhile, during my second and third co-op, I had to adjust to working virtually during a pandemic. What I\u2019ve learned is that the job environment (especially in government) is always shifting, which is mostly out of my control. So, try not to sweat the small things; it just comes with the territory. <br\/><br\/><strong>2) Track Your Projects<\/strong><br\/><br\/>A huge part of my role involved juggling different projects all at once \u2014 which were all at various stages of the approval process. And whether you\u2019re an Excel type or more of a paper n\u2019 pen person, tracking your projects will help you stay ahead. In the final months of my third term, we experienced a snap election and entered a period known as interregnum (which generally means no public announcements or new initiatives could commence until after a new government was formed). As a member of the Client Engagement Unit, that essentially meant we had to put our \u201cpens down\u201d and hold off on publishing new web content or engaging in public outreach. While there were still plenty of things to do behind the scenes, I had to continue to keep track of what was on hold and what could move forward. (And be able to pick up a paused project several months later once interregnum was lifted.)<br\/><br\/><strong>3) Put Yourself Out There!<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Raise your hand to volunteer for extra projects or to attend an event (if you have the capacity)! It\u2019s a great way to expand your skills and get the most out of your time during your co-op. In all three of my terms, I routinely helped the marketing and outreach side by attending career fairs (this year virtually, of course). It was a great way to connect directly with the people using the services and resources I helped create \u2014 which was the best kind of feedback. And by trying new things, it helped me learn about the different directions I could potentially take my career. (And hopefully will help you too!)<br\/><br\/>While these takeaways only brush the surface of all the valuable lessons, insights, and professional growth I gained during my co-op terms with the Client Engagement Unit, I hope they will help you start your experience on a positive note. So be ready to pivot on a moment\u2019s notice, keep up-to-date notes on all your projects, and don\u2019t hesitate to put yourself out there. You\u2019ve got this!

I came to Victoria to pursue a Master of Global Management degree at the Royal Roads University. Before starting my co-operative education (co-op) term, I had worked on several projects funded by the B.C. Provincial Government which further steered my determination to find an opportunity with the BC Public Service. <br\/><br\/>As part of my internship to complete my master\u2019s program, I was successful in landing a position with the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training. As a Client Engagement Analyst, I had the responsibility to help create content for the WorkBC website, market its tools and resources through the various social media platforms and attend outreach events to establish a first-hand connection with our stakeholders. <br\/><br\/>Although the idea of working for the BC Public Service was intimidating initially, I had the support of an experienced and understanding supervisor and team who truly wanted me to learn and grow. I had prior work experience in digital marketing and could contribute further to the operations of the unit. My supervisor noticed this potential and provided me with the opportunity to train across multiple areas of operation within the unit. As a result, throughout my two co-op terms, I had become a key member in strategizing and executing multiple priority projects. Even though I had to deliver on responsibilities that were beyond the initial job description, I welcomed the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience and at the same time expand my areas of expertise. <br\/><br\/>Looking back, I had joined this position with a lot of expectations, and it is safe to say that this co-op experience met them all with some added pleasant surprises. During my tenure, I gained valuable professional work experience, built professional connections through networking and connected with individuals and communities across the province. Apart from that, being an avid traveller, I am grateful to have been able to explore the majestic beauty of B.C. After seven months of working alongside a group of extremely talented individuals, determined to serve the public, I have gained a fresh perspective and more respect for public servants. <br\/><br\/>Having a significant amount of work experience in your desired role or industry under your belt after graduation will help market you to potential employers. Co-op programs provide participants with valuable work experience to supplement a higher education. If you are already in a co-op program and are looking for employers, I would recommend the following steps: <br\/><br\/>1. Connect with your post-secondary institution\u2019s career office. Organizations and employers often reach out to career counsellors at universities and colleges to hire co-op employees. Communicating your career aspirations and goals might unlock potential co-op opportunities in your area. <br\/><br\/>2. Use the WorkBC.ca <a href=\"https:\/\/www.workbc.ca\/Jobs-Careers\/Find-Jobs\/Jobs.aspx\" >Job Board<\/a> to find job postings throughout the province. You can filter for \u201cco-op\u201d or \u201cstudent\u201d under job type to find employers looking for co-op employees.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, if you are interested in learning more about <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14611762\" >co-operative education<\/a>, you can read about its advantages and how it works.<\/p>","Related Topics Blurb":"Learn about Hasan's experience completing a co-op term with the Client Engagement Unit."}

It\u2019s a long road to discovery that begins with being employed and gaining valuable experience to determine the right career path. For many people, the biggest hurdle is moving from unemployment to employment. But even currently employed individuals can have a hard time upgrading their skills or taking the necessary steps towards more secure, well-paid employment that aligns with their interests.<br\/> <br\/>There are many factors that contribute to unemployment and precarious employment (i.e. workers who have unstable jobs, those who are poorly paid, or those in jobs that do not a match their skills).

Speak up. Be accountable.<\/strong><br\/> <br\/>Whether you are a summer intern or a vice president, you can be an ally for under-represented groups. Women, Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, people of colour, newcomers to Canada and individuals who identify as LGBTQ\/2S are under-represented in employment sectors across B.C.<\/p><p><em>Both visible and overlooked<\/em><\/p><p>In Canada, people of colour regularly face systemic racism and barriers in the workplace and in other parts of their lives.

Such conditions also affect their earnings.<\/p><p><em>Supporting Indigenous employees to thrive<\/em><\/p><p>Equality for all requires thoughtful engagement with Canada\u2019s First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis. Engagement and inclusion for Indigenous peoples begins with a deeper understanding of these diverse groups.<\/p><p><em>The skilled talent of newcomers<\/em><\/p><p>Immigrants and refugees have left all that they knew behind and are building a new life in Canada. Through their unique experiences and often strong educations, newcomers to Canada have unique perspectives and skills that can benefit any company that hires them. Yet time and time again, we hear that newcomers are not hired despite their qualifications, because they lack Canadian work experience. Many times, immigrants and refugees are filtered out of the process due to cultural differences in resume and cover letter formats, interview practices, or biased assumptions on language proficiency.<\/p><p><em>Removing barriers for people with disabilities<\/em><\/p><p>Research shows that having employees with disabilities improves a workplace\u2019s productivity, morale, and innovation, as well as a company\u2019s consumer reach, yet people with disabilities face significant stigma and workplace biases that prevent them from getting and keeping work.<\/p><p><em>Elevating women in the workplace<\/em><\/p><p>A gender inclusive workplace makes sure that women have a fair opportunity to be hired or promoted into any roles and to take part in the company\u2019s decision-making processes. While many workplaces achieve gender parity in lower level positions, representation of women starts to fall off at the level of manager.<\/p><p><em>Safe spaces for all sexual orientations and gender identities<\/em><\/p><p>Many queer, transgender, and Two-Spirit professionals have experienced bullying, rejection or exclusion in the workplace due to their gender identities or sexual orientation.

It also means doing the work of questioning your own biases. (We all have them!)<br\/> <br\/>Individuals from under-represented groups should not have to shoulder the burden of educating everyone on inclusive behaviours. Allies support them by stepping up and helping to shift behaviours and attitudes.<br\/> <br\/>Allyship at work involves educating others. It can be encouraging your peers to correct their language or behaviours. You can counter microaggressions that you observe. Depending on your position, you might have different opportunities to be an ally. You could encourage an individual to put their name forward for a role or project. You might consider being a mentor.

While a virtual work environment has its advantages, it\u2019s not always easy staying connected to your co-workers when you don\u2019t share the same space or go for lunch together weekly. Here are some tips and ideas for you to sustain healthy work relationships in a remote-working environment.<\/p><p><strong>1. Encourage video chat during team meetings<\/strong><\/p><p>For those of us who had been working remotely for a while now, working in sweatpants or pajama pants is not new. A lot of people prefer not to turn their cameras on during meetings unless it\u2019s mandatory. However, having your camera on heightens the level of communication with increased verbal cues and visual participation, and the familiarity of a friendly face. Make sure you have good lighting and little to no distractions A tip on encouraging video chat is to set a theme for the background of each meeting. This fun idea can double as an ice-breaker conversation starter \u2013 for example, dream travel destination in a post-COVID era!<\/p><p><strong>2. Regularly check-up on each other<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Every workplace uses different modes of e-communication to stay connected whether that be email, real-time multi-channel chat rooms, or a video conferencing platform i.e. MS Teams. If your workplace offers a more casual means of communicating, you can always stir things up by sharing a variety of content! Some ideas to keep the buzz going amongst your colleagues:<\/p><ul><li>Relevant articles or blog posts: it\u2019s important to say current to the time and a well-written article can compliment someone\u2019s day.<\/li><li>Who can say no to animal pictures? Send an update of your furry friend and share the wholesome energy!<\/li><li>Allow your colleagues to drop their two cents with a question of the week. You\u2019d be surprised by the interesting responses (i.e. who is a historic figure you most admire?).<\/li><li>Any life hacks you discovered during quarantine? Don\u2019t shy away from sharing your discoveries!<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>3. Have a virtual lunch or coffee break<\/strong><br\/><br\/>A regular break from work can improve productivity. Plus, a stretch break or a coffee break can help soothe our sore backs or strained eyes from sitting and staring at the screen all day. Share this time with a colleague or more to exchange your favourite recipes or chat about your day. You can utilize your lunchtime or coffee break to virtually catch up. Staying connected to your colleagues can bring new exhilaration to your work and help retain a healthy work environment.<br\/><br\/><strong>4. Host weekly or monthly challenges<\/strong><br\/><br\/>A remote working environment doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t feed your competitive spirit. Stay connected to your colleagues by hosting a long-term challenge that everybody can participate in. This can be a great excuse to check-up on each other daily, asking each other about their progress. Some ideas include:<\/p><ul><li>An exercise challenge (i.e. 30-day push-up challenge).<\/li><li>A baking challenge (i.e. who can recreate this recipe the best?).<\/li><li>A photo challenge (i.e. share your favourite picture of the Sunset).<\/li><\/ul><p>It doesn\u2019t always have to result in a winner, but a creative and engaging challenge can always add more fun to what can be a stressful time for most.<br\/><br\/><strong>5. Stay connected to at least one person<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Something as simple as checking-in at the start of your shift and reconnecting when you\u2019re clocking out can help you stay in touch with your office culture. Staying connected to at least one colleague, whether that be your direct superior, can prevent your progress from going unnoticed. Weekly updates or bi-weekly\/monthly meetings to discuss your performance with each others\u2019 feedback can improve your professional development and help you stay productive.<br\/><br\/>Regardless of the measures you\u2019re taking to stay connected, it\u2019s always important that you feel safe and healthy during a pandemic.

Some individuals are unable to stop working for financial reasons. Meanwhile, others may continue their careers because they like the social connection or find purpose in their job.<br\/><br\/>Many companies understand the added value that a mature worker brings to their workplace. Along with bringing experience and strong skill sets, employees with decades in the workforce can mentor younger staff and provide leadership in both formal and informal ways.<br\/><br\/>For a mature worker who is looking for employment, there are a few things to keep in mind during the process.<br\/><br\/><strong>Update Your Resume<\/strong><br\/>For many jobs, a resume is what gets you in the door. The tips below will help you highlight your experience and stand out from the crowd. <\/p><ul><li>Remove all references to your age in your resume. It\u2019ll be clear from your experience that you are a mature worker, but it\u2019s not necessary to add your birthdate or to include other age-related information.<\/li><li>Limit the length of your resume\u2014you want it to be short and easy to read. A resume isn\u2019t a detailed list of everything you have done; just include the highlights of your skills and overall experience. Do some research into the type of resume you need for your chosen industry.<\/li><li>Highlight times when your maturity and experience were helpful in previous jobs. If you mentored a younger staff member, include that. If you took the lead on projects, include what you did, how you showed leadership, and what the results were.<\/li><li>Create a professional-looking, digital copy of your resume. Many software programs have ready-made resume templates to use. While most job applications are done online today, an employer may still print a resume to read it. Making sure that your resume looks good in both digital and print formats is key.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Highlight Your Experience Instead of Hiding It<\/strong><br\/>Mature workers come with experience\u2014and for many companies, that\u2019s a great thing. It\u2019s important to remember this and to be confident in your abilities. On that note, here are a few things to keep in mind:<\/p><ul><li>\u201cOwn\u201d your maturity and experience. If you were in a job for a decade, show how your loyalty and dedication could benefit the next company. While you don\u2019t need to tell a potential employer your age (and it\u2019s illegal for them to ask), explain that you bring strong skills and solid experience, and give examples of times when the fact that you are a mature worker helped a company. Read how <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/13136131\" >Marilou\u2019s experience<\/a> brings value to her clients.<\/li><li>Manage the idea that you might be overqualified or have too much experience. You can do this by explaining why you want to work for the company and how your skills would be useful in the position that you want. Let them know that you are ready to pitch in and help where needed, that you are a team player, and that you are ready to roll up your sleeves and get to work.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Show That You Use Technology<\/strong><br\/>These days, technology is everywhere. You don\u2019t want your would-be employer worrying that you aren\u2019t up to date when it comes to using a computer, smartphone or other technology that they consider to be commonplace. There are ways to address this:<\/p><ul><li>Highlight the software and digital programs that you know how to use in both your resume and your interview. Mention tools that you have expertise with\u2014this could include programs for financial management, presentations or project management. Also list any courses or workshops that you have taken in this area.<\/li><li>If your interview is being held via videoconference, make sure that you are comfortable with whatever they use. Ask a family member or friend to do a mock interview with you using the technology so that you will come across as confident with it during the interview.<\/li><\/ul><p>Mature workers bring a range of benefits to a company.

Taking a gap year offers endless avenues for you to become a more well-rounded person while also avoiding burning out from constantly being on the grind. Although a gap year is usually heavily connotated with traveling, life has been different for many with travel restrictions \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make the most out of your virtual gap year! Here some ideas that you can consider.<br\/><br\/><strong>1. Research to create a plan<\/strong><br\/>Some people prefer to be more spontaneous, but if you want to optimize this period, researching possible programs or work opportunities and creating a solid plan before taking time off is a smart choice. Researching options before your gap year can also help you prepare for specific programs or opportunities that are time sensitive. You don\u2019t necessarily have to plan out your entire year, but a little bit of research can spark new inspirations and ideas. Programs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cangap.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canadian Gap Year Association<\/a> provides wonderful resources, while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gvicanada.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GVI<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goabroad.com\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Go Abroad<\/a> offer online courses or volunteer programs.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Work full-time<\/strong><br\/>Working full-time is not only a valuable experience but can also earn you some extra cash. A professional work experience can expand your network and allow you to dive into an industry you\u2019re interested in. There are many work experiences that you can carry out remotely, and whether you end up liking the work or not, it\u2019s still a valuable experience for you to narrow down to a possible career path.

Learn a new skill\u2026 or two!<\/strong><br\/>A gap year is a great opportunity to either teach yourself a new skill or enroll in a program \u2013 regardless of the method you go for, the possibilities are endless with resources available to you right from home. Learning a new skill can give you clarity on your interests, and perhaps impact your future studies or career path. Whether you\u2019re learning how to code or enrolling in a 101 course, this can propel your future career.<br\/><br\/><strong>4. Volunteer<\/strong><br\/>A lot of communities are in need especially during this unprecedented time. Locating a community or program to devote your time and effort can be fulfilling for many. Virtual volunteering is often flexible to your schedule with various options ranging from a one-time project to an ongoing scheduled basis. Volunteering also introduces you to like-minded and passionate people \u2013 getting to know similar people in your area can offer new opportunities.

If a deeply seeded passion of yours has been collecting dust for some time, it\u2019s time to revisit it with your full attention and dedication. Perfecting a craft takes time \u2013 which is why this can be a perfect chance for you to discover your true passion or your ultimate life path.

Continuous evaluation and progression of skills is a crucial part of life \u2013 strengthening your professional skills will help you advance in your career journey. There are many areas and ways in which you can improve your skills.<\/p><h4>1. Improve your communication skills<\/h4><p>Communications skills are possibly the most important with the greatest impact. However, such a vital skill needs to be consistently practiced and honed. Effective communication skills can help you when answering phone calls, drafting emails, and successfully carrying yourself in a resume or cover letter. Emails require clear and concise language, while things like annual reports or articles require more detail and time. If you are looking to refine your writing skills, explore resources such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grammarly<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.writersdigest.com\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writer\u2019s Digest<\/a>. Communication skills involve both writing and speaking abilities, which introduces our next point.<\/p><h4>2. Practice public speaking<\/h4><p>Being able to successfully get your point across to a group of people can be challenging, but rewarding and beneficial. If you\u2019re struggling to confidently speak in a group setting, try recording yourself \u2013 sometimes watching yourself speak in video format helps you pick up on things that you wouldn\u2019t have noticed otherwise. You can step out of your comfort zone by volunteering to chair the next staff meeting or joining your local toastmaster\u2019s club for more practice. For public speaking tips, read this <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ted.com\/a-ted-speaker-coach-shares-11-tips-for-right-before-you-go-on-stage\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog<\/a>.<\/p><h4>3. Become better at analytical research<\/h4><p>Research doesn\u2019t end after college. Having effective analytical and research skills is helpful when writing reports or developing new products. Remember to first break down a topic and examine all the background information you need. Then, organize all the resources you need like data or peer-reviewed articles \u2013 scan them to ensure they answer your questions. The best way to start research is to ask the right questions. For more information on strengthening your research skills, check out these <a href=\"https:\/\/publicgeneralist.com\/improve-your-research-skills\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tips<\/a>.<\/p><h4>4. Developing leadership and management skills<\/h4><p>When developing your leadership skills, it\u2019s a good idea to choose a role model whether it\u2019s a historical figure or someone within your organization, or if lucky, you may already have a mentor to learn from. Study the leaders you admire and become the role model yourself by demonstrating the attributes important to you. For inspiration, watch this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d_HHnEROy_w\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video<\/a> on leadership and management.<\/p><h4>5. Awareness of Ethics<\/h4><p>Ethics outline the appropriate behaviours in a work setting. Many professional decisions involve ethics. You can create a personal ethics code to hold yourself more accountable. Not only does the ethical practice help you grow as a person, but it can heighten the overall reputation of your organization.<\/p><h4>6. Hone your computer and technical skills<\/h4><p>Computer literacy has become a necessity: it increases productivity and organization in a digitized world. Your computer skills can range anywhere from basic knowledge of operating systems to advanced computer programming. If you want to learn more, enrol in educational courses like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/learning\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn Learning<\/a> , or check out resources such as Education Planner BC.

As an employer, building an employee-centric, inclusive work environment will only improve your business. <br\/><br\/>To help you put your employees first, find tips and resources below on reducing workplace barriers for employees with different abilities. <br\/><br\/><strong>1. Consider potential barriers.<\/strong><br\/>Just because you can\u2019t see a disability, doesn\u2019t mean that an employee isn\u2019t impacted in some way. Take some time to consider how your office procedures and policies can eliminate barriers.<br\/><br\/>Here are a few things to consider:<\/p><ul><li>How can you remove barriers in the office workspace for individuals with mobility issues? Watch out for chairs or equipment that make it more difficult to maneuver around the building.<\/li><li>Do you provide services or equipment for employees with visual impairments? This could be as simple as using accessible non-serif font in documents or remembering to insert mouseover text for digital images (so that screen readers can describe them). To learn more, check out the CNIB Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/cnib.ca\/sites\/default\/files\/2018-07\/CNIB%20Clear%20Print%20Guide.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clear Print Accessibility Guide<\/a>.<\/li><li>How can you adapt your meetings to assist employees with hearing impairments? Some individuals rely on reading lips to follow conversations, so make sure to face your audience while speaking or turn on your camera during a virtual conference call.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>2. Facilitate open and respectful communication with all employees.<\/strong><br\/>It\u2019s important to create a respectful and supportive work environment, one that will promote conversations around potential work barriers. Be sure to avoid singling out employees though. Find opportunities to allow all staff to provide input on reducing barriers in your work environment. If you have a small, tight-knit team, you might ask for their ideas during a meeting. Be aware that not everyone is comfortable participating or drawing attention to the ways they\u2019ve been impacted. If possible, offer a second option that allows employees to submit their feedback anonymously.<br\/><br\/><strong>3. Learn more about available Assistive Technology Services.<\/strong><br\/>As a leader, take some time to learn about the support services available to employees with disabilities (And reading this post is a great start!).

By creating an inventory, an employer can ensure that they have a well-rounded team that can help make the business succeed.<\/p><h3><strong>Benefits of creating a skills inventory<\/strong><\/h3><h4>1. Skills optimization<\/h4><p>Building a skills inventory of your staff can showcase each team members\u2019 area of expertise. Skills inventories allow easy access to locate the best resource for a job, whether it\u2019s the Excel wiz or master public speaker you are looking for. Having capable employees deliver projects and tasks that match their area of expertise, balances the workload and optimizes the service and quality of results.<\/p><h4>2. Career and succession planning<\/h4><p>A skills inventory can be utilized for career planning by an individual or team to monitor their current skill portfolio and reveal areas for growth and development. This could also prove useful when it comes to recruitment and promotion. It can also provide knowledge sharing\/transfer to assist with succession planning as employees move onto different employment opportunities.<\/p><h4>3. Continuous learning<\/h4><p>A skills inventory can drive your organization\u2019s training - consider training your employees for the skills your business needs by accessing a <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14619002\" >skills training program<\/a>. You could also include cross training employees into different roles or duties and responsibilities. Cross training is an effective way of strengthening your organization as your team can scale efforts to demand in various areas. Using the inventory, as well as staff interest, cross training can benefit your staff by learning from their colleagues and developing their own skillset.<\/p><h4>4. Digital transformation<\/h4><p>Digital transformation has become an essential part of most businesses and organizations in the last year. Assessing and evaluating the current level of technical skills in a team and determining the necessary steps to improve can be crucial in determining recruitment, training, and\/or <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/12593190\" >funding<\/a>.

Having this information documented into one format will allow you to better capture the skills of your employees. It can also provide a visual gap, which can assist in training needs or new hire recruitment strategies.<br\/><br\/>Many people often underestimate the range of skills they possess but brainstorming the different experiences you\u2019ve had by breaking it down into multiple categories can help you discover your attributes. Some categories to consider include:<\/p><ul><li><strong>Technical Skills: <\/strong>This is a very broad category and may include anything from Microsoft Excel to coding. Knowledge in areas like computer programming, content management, web development, and image and video editing is advantageous. Technical skills don\u2019t always have to be computer-related either, it could be numbers, accounting, financial modeling and more!<\/li><li><strong>Interpersonal Skills:<\/strong> Knowing how to communicate with people and forming strong relationships is crucial with whatever job you have. Interpersonal skills may include conflict management, public speaking and presentation abilities, delegation and teamwork.<\/li><li><strong>Intrapersonal Skills:<\/strong> Intrapersonal skills refer to internal dialogue and the emotional relationship one has with their self. Intrapersonal skills can include productivity, resilience, resourcefulness, attentiveness, flexibility, motivation and independence. It takes a lot of self-awareness and self-evaluation to pin down your intrapersonal skills to highlight, which are also intrapersonal skills in themselves!<\/li><\/ul><p>Creating a skills inventory is only the beginning - once the system starts rolling, it should be maintained to preserve its relevance. <br\/><br\/>There are many ways a business can approach assembling a skills inventory \u2013 you can refer to these <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sampletemplates.com\/business-templates\/skills-inventory-template.html\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">examples<\/a> for inspiration.

As a Client Engagement Analyst, my main responsibilities included creating content for the WorkBC website, managing and moderating social media platforms, and attending virtual career fairs to connect people to WorkBC resources.<br\/><br\/>My experience was fully remote and with no doubt, drawbacks of a fully virtual term exist. For one, I\u2019ve never actually met any of my colleagues in person. There\u2019s a big chance I won\u2019t recognize some of them in real life or get to meet them ever. Not to forget that a virtual environment makes it difficult to foster organic relationships amongst colleagues. Virtual communicating often deducts body language and tone, making room for potential misunderstandings too. Plus, knowing that a huge aspect of this position originally was to travel, a part of me feels that I\u2019ve missed out.<br\/><br\/>Despite it all, I am so grateful for this experience and loved every moment of it. My supervisor was attentive, yet also gave me the freedom to be self-driven. I felt heard with a sense of belonging, even from kilometers away. Additionally, I took steps to make the most out of my term.<br\/><br\/><strong>Getting involved<\/strong><br\/>I find it especially awkward to socialize in a virtual setting. However, I was still excited to find out that the ministry provides a diverse array of networking and professional development events for both co-op students and new employees. I benefited from Lunch & Learns, the Co-op Advisory Board, various information sessions, and my co-op learning group. I didn\u2019t always speak up or chair a meeting but listening to the advice and experiences of other people was very eye-opening. I highly recommend getting involved and creating a network of professionals.<br\/><br\/><strong>Stepping out of my comfort zone<\/strong><br\/>As my co-op project, I conducted a research project to analyze the user consumption of digital media on the WorkBC website. I chose to do so because I have limited experience with research in an office environment. The project not only helped me hone my analytical and critical thinking abilities but extended my professional portfolio. It\u2019s a good idea to choose a project that is parallel to your interests and your career prospects because co-op terms should act as a steppingstone for you.<br\/><br\/><strong>Having fun!<\/strong><br\/>Considering that my usual commute to UBC was a 3+ hour round trip, the distance from my bed to my desk felt like liquid gold. Not to mention that getting to work in your PJ\u2019s is pure luxury. Working from home allowed me to save up on rent (not having to relocate to Victoria) and time. With all the extra time, I got to cook my favourite meals during lunch and enjoyed my hobbies after work. Focusing on the advantages of remote work made it easy for me to keep a stable and healthy mindset throughout my work term. <br\/><br\/>My term with the ministry was a special experience and comparable to any of my previous work experiences. I met such amazingly professional people that working alongside them alone inspired me to better carry myself. The work term demystified my previous prejudices on government work being mundane and stern, as my experience was the exact opposite. I encourage others to read more on previous co-op experiences like <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14865039\" >Hasan<\/a> and take a shot at working for the provincial government if interested.

We\u2019d like to take you behind the scenes to get a better understanding of why and how these resources were made \u2013 as it turns out, quite a bit is involved in getting a new section of the site online and in service. <br\/><br\/><strong>A Look Behind the Scenes<\/strong><br\/>This new section of the site was a collaborative effort that involved the active participation of teachers, career counsellors, the <a href=\"https:\/\/ces.bc.ca\/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CES Career Education Society<\/a>, the Ministry of Education (EDUC) and the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training (AEST). Through partnership, we were able to take the following steps. <br\/><br\/>1. <u>The Engagement Phase<\/u><br\/>Together, AEST and EDUC developed a survey. We asked teachers and career counsellors to share their experiences and preferences; everything from what type of technology they prefer to use in the classroom, to what teaching tools they find useful (and not-so-useful) while teaching career education curriculum. An essential piece of service design is understanding the needs of the user; we asked and listened to the thoughts of over 160 participants. Then, we identified the themes and determined the possible solutions.<br\/><br\/>2. <u>The Design and Development Phases<\/u><br\/>Over the next few weeks, the project team worked with designers to create design concepts and review them with teachers and career counsellors. These mock-ups \u2013 a sample of the new microsite \u2013 featured the requirements identified during the engagement phase. We built and rebuilt; we considered sets of functionality, searchability, useful tags, subscription notifications, imagery, colour palettes and lesson plan content. There were some ideas which we liked but turned out to be too complex for our timeline \u2013 but these ideas aren\u2019t gone, they\u2019re just saved for another day.<br\/><br\/>In parallel, all of our existing career education materials and resources were thoroughly reviewed in relation to the EDUC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/curriculum.gov.bc.ca\/curriculum\/career-education\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Career Education Curriculum<\/a>. In some cases, lesson plans were completely rewritten by subject matter experts at the CES Career Education Society. Additionally, EDUC\u2019s curriculum department provided advice on lesson plan standards and things to look out for moving forward. This \u201cinformation renovation\u201d produced up-to-date lesson plans, learning activities and teacher tips with the intended purpose for in-class and\/or online use. Completing this step in parallel with design and development allowed for over 100 pages of content to be prepared for a new content management system and detailed with metadata for the search and filter functionality we were also busy setting up.<br\/><br\/>3. <u>The Usability Testing Phase <\/u><br\/>Next, we invited 20 educators, including teachers, substitute teachers, teaching assistants and career counsellors to test it out. We included educators teaching in rural areas of the province as well as in cities; educators spanning all grades, from elementary (K-5), to middle (6-9) and high school (10-12). During a 30-minute session, educators were asked to complete a variety of tasks by navigating through the newly designed prototype, as we eagerly recorded results from their user experience.<br\/><br\/>This was another exciting opportunity to see and hear directly from our intended audience. We noted their challenges and successes. Changes, edits and solutions became business requirements and were implemented into the newly designed microsite.<br\/><br\/>4. <u>The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Phase and Launch<\/u><br\/>In a secure testing environment, our internal UAT team conducted several rounds of testing. They identified issues and worked with developers to apply the fixes. After issues were resolved and a few other internal launch requirements were met, we had obtained the green light to go public and launch.<br\/><br\/><strong>Seeing the Benefits<\/strong><br\/>Over the last few years, we\u2019ve seen far too many events and opportunities put on pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/number41media1.gathercontent.com\/item\/14607008\" >Find Your Fit<\/a>, is a prime example. As a result of this gap, our team was determined to find alternative ways to continue to promote WorkBC.ca career information and resources for educators and youth. The creation of Career Education Resources provides more access to teachers and career counsellors as they help students explore the future.<br\/><br\/>Career Education Resources is a one-stop \u201cshop\u201d for teachers and career counsellors to find up-to-date information that is aligned with B.C.\u2019s K-12 career education curriculum. <br\/><br\/>Discover the large collection of resources, lesson plans, learning activities, exercises and tools.
