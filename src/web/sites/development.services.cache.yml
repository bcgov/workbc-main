    # Renderer automatic placeholdering conditions:
    #
    # Drupal allows portions of the page to be automatically deferred when
    # rendering to improve cache performance. That is especially helpful for
    # cache contexts that vary widely, such as the active user. On some sites
    # those may be different, however, such as sites with only a handful of
    # users. If you know what the high-cardinality cache contexts are for your
    # site, specify those here. If you're not sure, the defaults are fairly safe
    # in general.
