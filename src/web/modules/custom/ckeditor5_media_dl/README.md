## Development

In the module directory, run `yarn install` to set up the necessary assets. The
initial run of `install` may take a few minutes, but subsequent builds will be
faster.

After installing dependencies, plugins can be built with `yarn build` or `yarn
watch`. They will be built to `js/build/{pluginNameDirectory}.js`.
